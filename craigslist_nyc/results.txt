Don't worry if you haven't read them, we won't judge you, we'll just quietly feel badly that your childhood was clearly almost entirely devoid of meaning.<br>\n<br>\nMany fantastic humans with wildly different backgrounds, ideas, and passions have called Redwall home over the last four years, and much magic has been made over potluck dinners, themed gatherings, and spontaneous moments born sitting by the fire, around the piano, or in the never-ending nooks and crannies that emerge out of our bizarrely long and slightly disorienting hallway. We have a large common area and generally throw a couple large events each year, and really enjoy hosting people for group dinners. We keep the apartment tidy, and occasionally chip in for deeper cleaning. The atmosphere here is laid back - we all have lots going on with school, work, and play and value coming home to a place that feels easy, warm, and supportive.<br>\n<br>\nWe're located directly across the street from the Divinity School, a stone's throw from Marsh Botanic Gardens, Prospect Gardens, and the Yale Farm, and an easy walk to East Rock, Downtown, Wooster Square and many more great places. We are also located directly on the Yale Shuttle and New Haven Transit bus lines, with stops right outside the door. We also have a very large parking lot behind the building where you can park for free if you are bringing a car and a secure indoor bike storage room.<br>\n<br>\nThe apartment is extraordinarily large, and is really more like a house. We have an enormous living room with a fireplace, spacious formal dining room, two-room kitchen and pantry that have been recently renovated and have brand-new appliances, and the bedrooms are all very big. The apartment gets fantastic light, and many of the rooms boast spectacular unobstructed views of West Rock park. There also is a new washer/dryer in the apartment that is free to use. The entire apartment has been updated, but still retains its historic charm, with beautiful old details throughout. We really love it here!<br>\n<br>\nSadly many of our beloved roommates are graduating this year and moving onto bigger and better things (except for their new housing, which will almost certainly be smaller and shittier than Redwall). We will have four bedrooms available for rent starting in August/September and one room available starting in January. All rooms are $635/month, which includes heat and hot water. We split internet, electric, and gas evenly each month. Though our lease runs on the academic calendar and we are located on the Yale campus, we are a home for both students and professionals and are open to renting to anybody whether or not they are a student or affiliated with the university. We are excited to continue our tradition of bringing together people with diverse backgrounds and interests so we can keep learning from each other and broadening our horizons.<br>\n<br>\nAs mentioned, we have a dog and two cats. If you are an animal lover, they are fantastic companions. They are all mellow and sweet and do not typically provoke allergies for people. However, if you are sensitive to animals, or really dislike animal hair, this is probably not the place for you. We may be able to accommodate another small dog (and our medium dog would be thrilled). Our feline overlords, however, will not tolerate any other cats and have sworn merciless vengeance should we even whisper about such things. So don't ask if you can bring your cat.<br>\n<br>\nIf you're interested in living with us, send us a paragraph about yourself and we can go from there.    </section>"

This is a really great apartment in an awesome area and is such a great deal. <br>\n<br>\nAbout the apartment: <br>\nThis is a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in a 3 unit walk-up building. The apartment is located on the 3rd floor. The landlord lives on the 1st and 2nd floors with his family and another family lives on the 4th floor. There is FREE washer/dryer (2 washers, 2 dryers) in the basement. The building is situated in a great location and easily accessible to the A, B, C, D, 2, 3. The block is incredibly adorable and is in a row of historic brownstones (there are annual block parties, monthly block meetings, and neighborhood beautification initiatives to plant flowers around the trees along the sidewalks). <br>\n<br>\nAbout the room: <br>\nI'm looking for someone to takeover my room which is a private bedroom with a private bathroom. The room is the smallest room in the apartment but that's why you get the private bathroom and pay the same amount as each roommate. The room is about 10'x10' with enough room to fit a Queen bed (I have one and it's pictured). I am also selling the bed (which is a great memory foam mattress that has been bagged and protected carefully to prevent bed bugs since I bought it two years ago), bed frame, curtains, ikea black 6x6 shelf and basically anything you see in the photos including the etagere in the bathroom with baskets. We can talk a bundle price if you're interested in any of those things. <br>\n<br>\nThe apartment's common areas are spacious (you can see the living room) and there's a full kitchen. There's air conditioning and heat as well as an intercom system in the apartment for your late night food deliveries. The entire apartment is laid out in hardwood flooring except for the bathrooms where there's tiling. Utilities typically run ~$80-120/month per person including Internet. <br>\n<br>\nAbout the roommates: <br>\nI have two roommates both in their mid to late 20s. One guy, One girl. They're both working professionals (one is a nurse, the other is a computer engineer) and are incredibly considerate about common areas. We all mostly do our own thing and keep to ourselves but will occasionally hang out for happy hours and roommate excursions/scrabble. <br>\n<br>\nAbout you: <br>\nYou must have good credit and be a considerate and clean person. You should also have a gross income that is at least 2.5X the rent. Our landlord values having good people as tenants especially since he lives in the building with his family, so we're looking for responsible, clean, and nice people. We don't throw raging parties and we take care of the apartment (which is why our rent has stayed the same for several years now and we want to keep it that way!)<br>\n<br>\nI'm leaving the apartment May 31st so move-in is available anytime after that. You'd be signing a new 1-year lease with my other two roommates. If you're interested please tell me about yourself and write Harlem Rocks somewhere in the subject line. <br>\n<br>\nThanks and happy room hunting! <br>\n<br>\n    </section>"

The building is about 10 years old, very clean and bug free.<br>\n<br>\nNeighborhood:<br>\nThe Atlantic Ave/Barclay's Center Express Subway and LIRR station (2/3/4/5/B/D/N/R trains) is 4 blocks away. The Fulton G and C stops are 2 blocks away. Stop and Shop, Best Buy, Target, and the Atlantic Terminal Mall are literally 1 block away. Neighborhood has a bookstore, 24-hour bodegas, laundromat, Crunch Gym, caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants etc. Ft Greene Park is 3 blocks away and Prospect Park (where I go running) is less than a mile to the south.<br>\n<br>\nRoommate:<br>\nI'm a 40-year old male, with a warm and friendly personality. I work in Accounting so my hours are a standard 9-6pm. I'm easy going and expect the same - someone fairly mature who is conscientious about cleaning up after themselves and respectful. I think it's nice to feel a sense of community so I'm always happy to chat but also respect the need for privacy. I rarely have multiple guests over, but I enjoy baking homemade pizzas and will host the occasional dinner party.<br>\nThe rent is $1215 plus utilities (Con Ed and Spectrum high speed internet) which average about $70/month. To setup an appointment to view the apartment, please send a reply with a short description of yourself. Proof of income, 1st month's rent and security deposit of $1215 are required prior to move in.<br>\n    </section>"

You found it! <br>\n<br>\nI will be in Europe during July and August. I am a music teacher/performer. My one bedroom apartment has full eat-in kitchen and full bathroom. <br>\n<br>\nBig screen TV (sorry no cable TV but access to Netflix and Pandora) <br>\nAC in both living room and bedroom <br>\nFull size keyboard <br>\nQueen size bed  <br>\nWiFi throughout the apartment <br>\n<br>\nThe pictures say the rest. The only thing that differs is that I now there is a desk that replaces one of the futons in the living room, and new floor tiles have been put in the kitchen.<br>\n<br>\nAbout transportation: <br>\n<br>\nIf you have a car, there is alternate days parking on the street.<br>\nIf you need public transportation, the D Train is two short blocks away on 205th street. Since it is the last stop on D line, you are guaranteed a seat on your way to Manhattan, which is 35 minutes away (to 59th st. Columbus Circle). <br>\n<br>\nThis is an ideal place for Montefiore Hospital medical staff as the hospital is within walking distance, and it is also a 10 min. walk away from the Botanical Garden. <br>\n<br>\nAbout the surrounding: <br>\n<br>\nPublic library: 2 blocks away <br>\n<br>\nShopping: Within a couple of blocks you can find CVS, FoodTown supermarket, groceries, dry cleaning, fast food (Pizza, Chinese, McDonald's, Subway) and banks (Bank of America and Chase). <br>\n<br>\nRecreation: There are three public parks available. Two of them within 5 minutes walk, one of which is newly built with running track and soccer/football field. The third one is Van Cortland Park which is the equivalent of Central Park in the Bronx. Equipped with a pool, running track, tennis courts, golf course and beautiful scenery. It is about 25 minutes walk from the apartment. There is a newly built Crunch gym literally around the corner. You can join without a contract for $9,95 a month.<br>\n<br>\nThe total monthly rent is $1,490 therefore $2,980 for the entire stay (utilities included). Priority will be given to people who are looking to sublet the place for the whole two months period, but other offers are welcome as well.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are interested, please reply to this ad via email.<br>\n    </section>"

I've been in the apartment for almost three years now and my roommate is moving out to go to California with her boyfriend. Rent is $1200 for the master bedroom. June 1st move in date. Below are some details:<br>\n<br>\nThe Apartment - is a huge beautiful place! Lots of light. Stainless steel appliances. Living room, dining room, huge kitchen. New bathroom. The apartment is also fully furnished. <br>\n<br>\nThe Room - The master bedroom is available for rent for $1200 for a June 1st move in date. The room is pretty big, also gets a lot of light, has two windows and a nice sized closet. Please note, this room is not furnished. <br>\n<br>\nThe Neighborhood - We are right off of 30th Avenue in Astoria. Tons of great restaurants and bars. The grocery store is right across the street, along with a laundry mat and a pizza place. We are 2 blocks from the R/M and about a 12 minute walk to the N/Q. Very quite street with families. It's a nice neighborhood to live in. <br>\n<br>\nRoommates - Just to give a little information about me, my name is Laurie and, like I said above, I've been in the apartment for about 3 years now, and I've been in Astoria for about 9 years. I work in the city in finance, typical 9-6 schedule. I am outgoing and friendly, I'm really clean, and I really love this apartment! I think you will too! <br>\n<br>\nOne last and final point, I am looking for someone who can commit to a year lease. The landlord is really great and they take such good care of the property. They will be looking for someone with good credit, full time job, and who will commit to a year. <br>\nLooking forward to hearing from you!<br>\n    </section>"

This is a sunny bedroom in a 3BR apt located on Broadway between 125 and LaSalle for the period 6/1-7/31 with possible option to renew the lease after 7/31.

Currently there's 1 male and 1 female living here!....You'll have your own private room with key locked door. Share bathroom and common areas!.....<br>\n<br>\nPLEASE READ:<br>\n<br>\nSorry no couples nor men this time unfortunately!. We're looking for another FEMALE to balance the chemistry In the household!<br>\n<br>\nYOU:<br>\n\"Mature, Opened minded, employed &amp; responsible\". . .. . .. . .. . ..<br>\n<br>\nPlease, no Xenophobes! I'd prefer someone who's able to live with and be open to cultures besides their own. My place is clean so I'd like a person who'll also keep it that way. Non smokers only/anything!,. I don't bring the party home so please do the same! Company every now and then and overnight guest isn't a problem especially on weekends but don't turn my place into your hotel. Light cooking is fine and gas and electricity is included as an \"INCENTIVE\" to renting out the room but not to be abused because the utility bills are very high. I have to pay to HEAT the apartment, the WATER and of course COOK.<br>\n<br>\nMe:<br>\nSelf employed entrepreneur in his late 40's.. I'm transitioning as a Photographer from an 20 year independent bookseller so its been pretty hectic juggling these positions. I'm heterosexual and involved In a relationship. My girlfriend has her own place, so you'll rarely if ever see or meet her. I respect other people's privacy and I'm looking for the same in a roomie. I don't really bother anybody and I kinda stay to myself but I'm also very social and possess a world of knowledge and am always willing to share. I like to consider myself as being very vocal on many issues and I often exchange thoughts and ideas on most topics! (excluding politics and religion) but ultimately, i like to give people their space (law of proxemics) and feel at home. I'm the lease holder and have been for 5 years now!. So you'll be granted the same rights as me but be a temporary guest so to speak and if we both agree, extend your stay perhaps 6-12 months more if we so decide!. My motto is: live and let live, so respect is paramount!<br>\n<br>\nHer:<br>\nShe's a 26yr old pioneering millennial, self employed in the fashion industry, actress &amp; yoga instructor. She's a tidy person but not OCD, keeps the common areas clean and cleans up after using them and is always willing to help keep them that way. She's very quiet and mainly stays to herself but is also very social once she gets to know you. She's also sweet and kind and has a sunny personality; which not only makes for a good friend but most importantly, a joy to live with and be around. She loves to read books, jogs several times per week, watch Indy films and is a big fan of Netflix and prides herself on personal care and healthy eating. She's organized, not selfish and respects other people's privacy and space and doesn't bring the party home and would like to room with someone who possesses some of her qualities if not most of them!<br>\n<br>\nWhat's Included?:......<br>\nThere will be free Internet service and utilities Included with your rent of $950 per month. 1st, last and one month's security. Again, this is a month to month temporary/transient rental, 2-3 months to start, possibly more!...Total $2850 to move in.<br>\n<br>\nThe Neighborhood:.....<br>\nGritty but safe with all races and cultures living harmoniously. This predominately working class community is in total transition as is all of Bushwick but hasn't lost its flair. It houses a near by 24hr Laundromat on Cooper St, Covert Coffee Shop, A Liquor store on Rockaway, Grocery stores, Spanish Restaurants, (Super Pioneer &amp; Bravo Super Markets). Jamaican and Indian restaurants, A Pizza shop, Plenty of 99 cent stores, Duncan Donuts, Subway, The Evergreen bar &amp; the popular Salud Bar &amp; Grill on Bushwick avenue and Moffat Street to name a few.<br>\n<br>\nFor further note:.....<br>\nYou will be residing within a short walking distance (3 min, Yay!) of the \"J &amp; Z\", M, L, A, &amp; C trains, each about 25min or less commute to Manhattan. If this sounds like a place that you'd like to rest your head and make your temporary home. Then come meet me and see the room because i can guarantee that you'll feel safe and at home throughout your entire stay!!,<br>\n<br>\nPLEASE DON'T FORGET TO:<br>\nLet me know a little about yourself: AGE, YOUR MOVE DATE, Please know about the most popular/hip place In Brooklyn, BUSHWICK!, highly recommended but not mandatory and I'll get back to ASAP!<br>\n<br>\nDue at signing:<br>\n$950.00 per month, 1st, last and one month's security to move In...Total $2850.00<br>\n<br>\nI Hope To Hear From You But If Not!.

Honestly, we love our apartment and it's in a really great location. I'm looking for one person to take her place! <br>\n<br>\nABOUT YOUR NEW APARTMENT: <br>\n<br>\n-\tAt the corner of 125 and Broadway in Morningside/West Harlem. <br>\n-\tA (literal) minute away from the very reliable 1 train and about ten minutes from the ABCD. <br>\n-\tIf buses are your thing we have those, too. Outside of our front door is the M4 and M104 for easy access to the east side. The M60 is five minutes away,  making getting to Queens (and LGA) super convenient. <br>\n-\tRiverside Park and the beautiful Hudson River pier are minutes away. <br>\n-\tFairway Market is a 6-minute walk and C-Town and Duane Reade are even closer. <br>\n-\tWe sit above many restaurants and bodegas. Starbucks moved a couple of doors down a couple of months ago. A new cocktail bar opened up recently (their pineapple cider is to die for), Jin Ramen is down the block, there is a killer juice/ health food store right downstairs, and Dino BBQ is also very close. <br>\n-\tThere are also tons of great food/ bar/ grocer options on Amsterdam ave, only a five minute walk away.<br>\n-       There are two laundry services as well as a laundromat within two blocks of the apartment. <br>\n-\tColumbia is a ten minute walk away!<br>\n-\tThe room has a window, a pretty spacious closet, and could fit a twin or full bed. <br>\n-\tThe rent is $1,100/month. Utilities generally run around $100/month per person. It's a little higher during the summer. <br>\n<br>\nI AM:<br>\n<br>\n-\tA 25-year-old female, usually gone between 12:00 PM &amp; 8:00 PM, M-F. <br>\n-\tOften ghostlike (ask my current roommate), so often it'll feel as if you have the apartment to yourself. <br>\n-\tPretty laid back and I like to bake cookies. <br>\n-\tOpen to having friends over! <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTO MOVE IN: <br>\n<br>\n-\tYou'll need a sense of humor plus $2,200 (first month &amp; security). <br>\n-\tTo sign onto the lease (which, is necessary) you have to prove your income (they like ~$60,000/year) or have a guarantor to back you. <br>\n-\tThe move in is for June 1st, but for the right person, earlier is definitely possible. <br>\n-\tWe are looking to show the apartment on this Sunday afternoon. Please shoot me a message to set this up. We look forward to hearing from you! :)<br>\n    </section>"

Like to keep the home cozy, clean, and comfortable and would like to find others that are into a \"family vibe\", like if someone else's dishes are in the sink you don't mind washing or if the garbage needs to go out you'll take the initiative to do it, and if you have extra kale and cant finish it you'll share =) hahha<br>\n<br>\nLikes- tequila, open &amp; honest communication, fresh air, astrology (we're a virgo &amp; capricorn), Broad City, SVU marathons, that moment when you step onto the subway platform and the train arrives seconds later, cashmere, adventures, &amp; good vibes. <br>\n<br>\nDislikes- door slamming, passive aggressiveness, filth, heavy walkers, indoor cigarette smoking, most reality TV, laziness, &amp; when cabinet doors are left open and main lights aren't turned off. Would like to have roommates that are capable of paying rent/utilities in a timely manner and to communicate any issues so that there's no passive aggressiveness or petty actions. <br>\n<br>\nThe apt is a 4bd/2bath in bedstuy BK off Myrtle-Willoughby G train maybe a 10-15 min walk from Myrtle JM trains.

We're looking for two new tenants to sign a one-year lease and move into our fantastic, sunny 5-bedroom, 2.5 bathroom Upper West Side apartment on June 1st. True private bedrooms...no fake walls or anything. Large living room, huge kitchen, laundry in the building, live-in super. The common areas are completely furnished.<br>\n<br>\nThe two tenants moving out are one girl and one guy, moving out of the area or in with a significant other. The original leaseholders signed the lease more than 10 years ago and it's been passed down throughout the years. It's truly a hidden gem in Manhattan. I love this place and you will, too.<br>\n<br>\nThe bedrooms each have a tall closet, large window and can hold a queen size bed and a dresser comfortably. <br>\n<br>\nThe apartment is located on the corner of West 96th and Broadway, a 30-second walk to the 1-2-3 express trains: a 5-minute ride to Times Square, 8-minute ride to 14th Street, and 15-minutes to Wall Street. You'll be at 30 Rock in about 10 minutes! We've got all the major banks within a one block radius, Westside Market one block away, and Whole Foods 3 blocks away.

I'm a 29-year-old female seeking 2 clean and responsible roommates (preferably female) to fill 2 rooms in my future spacious and funky apt in Williamsburg for the summer. This apt is 2 blocks from the L, close to tons of bars and restaurants and easily accessible to/from Manhattan. This is the top floor of a pre-war house with a finished basement.<br>\n<br>\nI am filling 2 bedrooms for a summer sublet - ideally June 1 - Aug 31, but I'm flexible on dates. Month-to-month is also an option. Both rooms will require one month's rent for security deposit. Unfortunately, there will be no opportunity to view the apt prior to June 1, but I can answer any questions and provide pics. <br>\n<br>\nI will be furnishing the common areas; the bedrooms will be unfurnished.<br>\n<br>\nBedroom A - $1300/mo - can fit a full-sized bed, dresser and clothing rack. There is no closet but a built-in storage space. There is a large window. This room might have an opportunity for a longer-term lease. <br>\n<br>\nBedroom B - $1350/mo - can fit a queen-sized bed and dresser. There is a large closet and 2 large windows. The term for this room will be June 1 - Aug 31. <br>\n<br>\nMore info upon request. No couples please.<br>\n    </section>"

Me and my roommate are staying and need to find 2 others to fill rooms for $775 $850. Utilities range from $50-$75/month but depend on season and usage.<br>\n<br>\nWe're 420 friendly/social drinkers, prefer the party to be kept outside of the home (apt is too 'cozy' for more than like 5 ppl) but totally cool having friends over/sleepovers just not like alloooooot. Like to keep the home cozy, clean, and comfortable and would like to find others that are into a \"family vibe\", like if someone else's dishes are in the sink you don't mind washing or if the garbage needs to go out you'll take the initiative to do it, and if you have extra kale and cant finish it you'll share =) hahha<br>\n<br>\nLikes- tequila, open &amp; honest communication, fresh air, astrology (we're a virgo &amp; capricorn), Broad City, SVU marathons, that moment when you step onto the subway platform and the train arrives seconds later, cashmere, adventures, &amp; good vibes. <br>\n<br>\nDislikes- door slamming, passive aggressiveness, filth, heavy walkers, indoor cigarette smoking, most reality TV, laziness, &amp; when cabinet doors are left open and main lights aren't turned off. Would like to have roommates that are capable of paying rent/utilities in a timely manner and to communicate any issues so that there's no passive aggressiveness or petty actions. <br>\n<br>\nThe apt is a 4bd/2bath in bedstuy BK off Myrtle-Willoughby G train maybe a 10-15 min walk from Myrtle JM trains. Located next to a community garden, block away from laundromat and about 2 blocks from grocery store. Coffee shops, restaurants, bars and cute shops are all within walking distance and home depot is super close too if you're into that (i am lol) <br>\n<br>\nNeed to commit to a year lease starting June 2017 and able to pass credit check, provide proof of income and pay first/last/security deposit to move in.    </section>"

I have been in the apartment with her for about a year and a half and can attest that she is quiet, respectful, amiable, and outgoing.  She keeps the living room and kitchen clean and always takes care of any mess that she makes.  She is respectful of bringing guests over by checking in with me first, and we would request that you do the same.  <br>\n<br>\nNo couples.  Smokers are fine as long as you do not smoke in the apartment.  We are looking for a long-term roommate who will be staying for at least six months.<br>\n<br>\nThe bedroom is very roomy, even by non-New York standards. \u00a0Prospect Park is a short walk away.  The kitchen and living room are already furnished with everything you need, though perfectly open to working things out if you also have your own set of common space furniture.  I will be taking most of my furniture in my room with me, but if you visit and anything strikes your fancy, we can talk.<br>\n<br>\nThe apartment is a block away from laundry and a grocery store, as well as an avenue away from restaurants, bars, a Duane Reade, and a variety of other miscellaneous stores.  (We are also getting laundry in the building very soon.)  It is a 5 minute walk to the B and Q, and a 10 minute walk to the 2 and 5.  <br>\n<br>\nI am looking for someone to move in at latest August 1, though I am willing to be flexible around your schedule should you wish to move in earlier, though probably no earlier than July 1.<br>\n<br>\nRent is $1025/month, which works out to between $1080-$1100ish with all utilities and internet.<br>\n    </section>"

Any gender roommate is welcome.<br>\n<br>\nOne block from Montrose L stop and near restaurants and shops.

We've got a room available on the lower level of the apartment. It's huge, has large windows that open (screens open too) and let a ton of natural light in. As seen in the pictures, the room fits a full-size (or queen) bed, a large desk, and more. There's no closet, but the white clothing unit will stay in the room for you! <br>\n<br>\nOther amenities: bathroom with jacuzzi tub, rooftop access to a gorgeous roof with Manhattan skyline view, and a very sweet fluffy cat. <br>\n<br>\nRent is $1100/month and deposit is $1100 (due on move-in).

We have 1 bedroom available in a spacious 5 bed/3 bath townhouse-style duplex apartment in a luxury building between 96th street and West End Ave. Current roommate is moving out as she wants to move downtown after a few years in the Upper West.<br>\n<br>\nThe bedroom is 9' x 15', has a large closest, and can comfortably fit a queen-sized bed and 2 dressers. The current roommate can leave the blackout shades and mounted flat screen TV free of cost if you'd like. The available bedroom is on the lower level of the duplex and shares a bathroom with one other person who is very neat (and awesome!). <br>\n<br>\nThe building has great amenities including a full-time doorman, gym, laundry, and rooftop-deck. It also has easy access to 1/2/3 trains at 96th St, is next to Riverside Park and is close to Central Park. The apartment itself is split-level, 2 bedrooms/1 bathroom downstairs and 3 bedrooms/2 bathrooms upstairs with a large kitchen (including dishwasher and oven) and a HUGE, furnished living room with a flat screen TV/cable/Netflix account.<br>\n<br>\nUs: One gal, two guys in our mid/late twenties, with one additional room opening up soon <br>\n<br>\nWe like to keep a relaxed atmosphere in the apartment. We are all respectful, friendly and social but have our own lives too, so the apartment never feels crowded. We don't bring the party home and all contribute to the upkeep of the apartment by keeping the common areas clean.  Utilities run around $50-$60 per month for internet, cable TV and electricity, and we also hire a cleaner every month.  Management pays for gas and heat.<br>\n<br>\nRoom is available starting June 1st or 15th (somewhat flexible/ negotiable). For building approval, though, paperwork needs to be submitted ASAP with first month's rent + one month security deposit. Males or females are welcome to apply but no pets please!<br>\n <br>\nIf you're interested, send us an email telling us a little about yourself (social media links appreciated!) and hopefully we can set up a time to show the room. Thanks!<br>\n    </section>"

There is a nice open living room with a large couch and love seat (often occupied by our two friendly cats), and an eating area with table and some chairs. The kitchen has tons of counter space courtesy of a bar that divides it from the living room space, and is well-stocked with gear (food processor, blender, cookware etc.). There are beautiful parquet floors and lots of nice little pre-war touches like lovely moulding, tile work, and a stained-glass window in the bathroom.<br>\n<br>\nWe're one block away from the Q train, which can get you over the bridge to Manhattan in twenty minutes. We're also a two-minute walk from glorious Prospect Park's southeast corner- close to the 60-acre lake and the swans, ducks, egrets that live there as well as the more open spaces than one finds on the north side. Pretty much every amenity is within a block or two. There is a farmer's market on Sundays, a large supermarket a block away, a Duane Reade, laundromat, hardware store, discount housewares, jerk chicken, great cheap produce stands, coffee shops and bars.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough we're near a major intersection, we're tucked away at the end of a funny little one-block residential dead-end street, so it's usually pretty quiet. The smallness of the street makes it conducive to neighbors getting to know one another. Several buildings have flower gardens going in the warmer months that have also been bringing the neighbors out more and more.<br>\n<br>\nRoom is nice, approximately 15' x 8', with two windows. It is unusually shaped (a bit like the hull of a ship--wide at one end and narrower at the other), but can easily fit a full or queen bed, desk and/or dresser, and bookshelf. One entire wall of the room is closet space (!!!). It will be available for a June 1 move-in.<br>\n<br>\nAbout us:<br>\n<br>\nSays housemate 1: \"I'm a queer, white female in my early 30s. These days, I'm most excited about the musical, political, mindful-living communities/activities I'm a part of. I like to keep my life filled with opportunities to practice yoga, ride my bike, see live performances, &amp; eat at fun restaurants/cook for friends. I work a busy day job in Manhattan that keeps me out of the apartment during the day. I like my home to be a place where I can relax, kick my feet up, read a good book, and snuggle with my 2 sweet, affectionate kitties, and where my friends/roommates feel comfy too. I like being close to the Park, while having easy commute to surrounding Brooklyn neighborhoods.\"<br>\n<br>\nSays housemate 2: \"I'm a straight-identified, queer-friendly lawyer/herbalist in my late 30s. I like to travel, read, dance, and connect with people and organizations re-imagining how we grow food, work, make home, and make meaning (permaculture, cooperatives, gift economies, restorative justice etc.). Investing in community is an important aspect of my life, and having a harmonious home is part of that. When I'm not working, you can find me walking in Prospect Park, hosting potlucks, singing (I'm in a choir), or planning a trip that will get me as far out of the city and off-the-grid as possible.\"<br>\n<br>\nWe are laid-back and kind, respectful of private space but happy to be around one another when we're home. We frequent food coops and farmers markets and are open to sharing food staples when practical, as well as meals when we happen to all be home. We also enjoy unwinding on the couch or stoop, having a beer, and sharing the ups and downs of life in the big city. We keep the apartment relatively clean and are non-smokers. We have a month-to-month lease, but are hoping for someone who would like to join us and settle in for a while. While we love our two cats, we don't have space for more pets.<br>\n<br>\nRent is $750/month, heat included. Utilities (electric, cooking gas, internet) generally run about $40/month per person. <br>\n<br>\nCare to join our home?<br>\n<br>\nTell us a little about yourself!<br>\n<br>\n(Pictures above show the stoop, common areas, room for rent, and the view of the lake at our corner of Prospect Park.)    </section>"

My roommates just moved to Seattle, and I am listing two bedrooms in my awesome 3 bedroom apartment in BedStuy. The move-in date throughout May will be flexible, but June 1st is my deadline. Looking for a 1-year commitment from 6/1. <br>\n<br>\nSmall Bedroom: The small bedroom is $800 a month, and an $800 security deposit to move in. It's a sizable space and is the unfurnished room with the fancy rug in the pictures section. No closet or windows in the room, but a large skylight with lots natural light makes this bedroom a steal in this part of Brooklyn.<br>\n<br>\nThe Master Bedroom: $1200 a month and $1200 security to move in. This spacious bedroom, which is pictured with the cat on the bed, has its own balcony and own private FULL bathroom. Couples are welcome to apply, though the monthly rate and security deposit will be a bit more since there is an extra human in the living space. The room comes unfurnished and the cat is not included.<br>\n<br>\nFull kitchen with a full gas stovetop &amp; fridge. The living room is what makes this apartment a gem. It's a cavernous space with lightly accented walls and a ton of natural light. I also have a garden full of houseplants growing in the window, and the whole main living space I have furnished myself. <br>\n<br>\nUtilities: Utilities average about $75 a month per person, pretty standard. <br>\n<br>\nLaundry: Laundry is right around the corner, about a 3-4 min walk from the apartment.<br>\n<br>\nLocation: The apartment is located on Myrtle Ave, equidistant from the Myrtle-Willoughby G stop and the Myrtle Ave JMZ stop (about a 6-7 min walk in either direction). Super convenient for those looking for a short commute over the Williamsburg Bridge to Manhattan or those commuting within Brooklyn on the G.<br>\n<br>\nA little bit about me: I love listening to records, cooking, making music, and plotting to save the world. I'm out and about a lot but also do some work from home occasionally and like working in the common area. Black Mirror and Westworld are my favorite shows at the moment. 420 Friendly, big into the outdoors. If you're down for impromptu conversations about whether or not Blink 182 technically invented pop-punk, or whether it what society or Hunter S. Thompson that went insane, or whether Tarantino's revenge flicks are better than South Korean revenge flicks, this might be the place for you.<br>\n<br>\nShoot me over an email with a little bit about yourself &amp; any social profiles you choose to include, and we can figure out a time for you to come see the place. Talk to ya soon!<br>\n<br>\n    </section>"

Like to keep the home cozy, clean, and comfortable and would like to find others that are into a \"family vibe\", like if someone else's dishes are in the sink you don't mind washing or if the garbage needs to go out you'll take the initiative to do it, and if you have extra kale and cant finish it you'll share =) hahha<br>\n<br>\nLikes- tequila, open &amp; honest communication, fresh air, astrology (we're a virgo &amp; capricorn), Broad City, SVU marathons, that moment when you step onto the subway platform and the train arrives seconds later, cashmere, adventures, &amp; good vibes. <br>\n<br>\nDislikes- door slamming, passive aggressiveness, filth, heavy walkers, indoor cigarette smoking, most reality TV, laziness, &amp; when cabinet doors are left open and main lights aren't turned off. Would like to have roommates that are capable of paying rent/utilities in a timely manner and to communicate any issues so that there's no passive aggressiveness or petty actions. <br>\n<br>\nThe apt is a 4bd/2bath in bedstuy BK off Myrtle-Willoughby G train maybe a 10-15 min walk from Myrtle JM trains. Located next to a community garden, block away from laundromat and about 2 blocks from grocery store.

Me and my roommate are staying and need to find 2 others to fill rooms for $775 $850. Utilities range from $50-$75/month but depend on season and usage.<br>\n<br>\nWe're 420 friendly/social drinkers, prefer the party to be kept outside of the home (apt is too 'cozy' for more than like 5 ppl) but totally cool having friends over/sleepovers just not like alloooooot. Like to keep the home cozy, clean, and comfortable and would like to find others that are into a \"family vibe\", like if someone else's dishes are in the sink you don't mind washing or if the garbage needs to go out you'll take the initiative to do it, and if you have extra kale and cant finish it you'll share =) hahha<br>\n<br>\nLikes- tequila, open &amp; honest communication, fresh air, astrology (we're a virgo &amp; capricorn), Broad City, SVU marathons, that moment when you step onto the subway platform and the train arrives seconds later, cashmere, adventures, &amp; good vibes. <br>\n<br>\nDislikes- door slamming, passive aggressiveness, filth, heavy walkers, indoor cigarette smoking, most reality TV, laziness, &amp; when cabinet doors are left open and main lights aren't turned off. Would like to have roommates that are capable of paying rent/utilities in a timely manner and to communicate any issues so that there's no passive aggressiveness or petty actions. <br>\n<br>\nThe apt is a 4bd/2bath in bedstuy BK off Myrtle-Willoughby G train maybe a 10-15 min walk from Myrtle JM trains. Located next to a community garden, block away from laundromat and about 2 blocks from grocery store. Coffee shops, restaurants, bars and cute shops are all within walking distance and home depot is super close too if you're into that (i am lol) <br>\n<br>\nNeed to commit to a year lease starting June 2017 and able to pass credit check, provide proof of income and pay first/last/security deposit to move in.    </section>"

(already paid when we moved in last year-this is a great deal, any other place in Hoboken would charge a broker fee)<br>\n-Instead, there will be a paperwork fee from the realty office, around $170 for each new tenant.<br>\n<br>\nUtilities:<br>\n-Heat and hot water included<br>\n-We pay electric, cable and internet, coming out to around $100/ea in the summer (depending how many a/c units), and around $40/ea the rest of the year!<br>\n<br>\nRequirements:<br>\n-Female, preferably mid-20s<br>\n-Non-smoker<br>\n-No criminal record, no prior evictions (the realty office will automatically decline, and they will check references)<br>\n-Have good credit and/or a co-signer<br>\n-MUST be able to pay rent, security, and paperwork fee AND sign the lease by May 15th for July 1st move in (this is an absolute must, non-negotiable)<br>\n-Preferably working professionals with 9-5 or similar hours<br>\n<br>\nAbout Me:<br>\nI am a 24 year old from the San Francisco bay area in California. I moved out here about a year ago just for a change of pace (have some family out here as well). I have lived in Hoboken since last July and work in Manhattan for a law firm full time. I love to work out, watch sports/attend games, hiking, etc. Also want to get into a Zog sports league!<br>\n<br>\nCurrently the dynamic in our apartment is very social, and I would like to keep it that way when my roommates move out! Not interested in people who will be in their rooms all day. During the weeknights we are normally hanging around in the living room together, watching tv/netflix, eating dinner, laughing, drinking wine, etc. but go to bed at decent hours. On the weekends we go out to brunch, drinks, or sometimes do our own things, but not looking for people who bring the party home on a regular basis.<br>\n<br>\nPlease contact me with any questions you may have, and also please include Facebook or any social media if possible. Thanks! :)    </section>"

Super quick commute to Philly/Princeton and less than a mile from NJ Transit Morrisville train station. I'm moving in in a few weeks (hence the unfurnished pics). Nice area, half a mile from the river. Newish washer, dryer, oven, dishwasher and microwave. All I will have is WiFi so if you want cable ran to your room it's on you. I'm putting a brand new couch, furnishings and a brand new 55inch TV in the living area but it will be up to you to furnish your own bedroom.<br>\n<br>\nHouse is 1750 square feet which includes the furnished attic where I will be living. Kitchen is HUGE as is the \"family area\". You'll have your pick of the three bedrooms on the second floor. private parking spots out back so you'll never have to worry about parking.<br>\n<br>\nI'm a late twenties working professional male. No live in girlfriends/boyfriends please - other than that I don't mind if you have visitors as long as everything is reasonable. Sunday - Thursday nights I'm usually pretty quiet and reserved as I work a 9-5 Monday through Friday. No smoking in the house, feel free to have a puff out on the big back deck if that's your thing. The place has one main bathroom so we will be sharing that. I'm organized (not a neat freak though) and expect the same with the common areas, could care less with what you do with your own space.<br>\n<br>\nTo move in I will need 1 month security deposit + first months rent. You must have a steady job, good credit, and solid references please. Other than that I'm a real easy going guy - I spend a lot of time out side exercising/fishing etc... This is definitely a super cool place and I plan on doing a few upgrades to make it even better. Please send me a brief email about yourself and I'll get back to you asap, if this post is still up the room is still available.<br>\n<br>\nThanks!!<br>\n<br>\nJon-    </section>"

It'd be nice to have someone reliable with a good sense of humor and an easy-going attitude. The lease starts July 1st, but the move-in-date could be sooner as my current roommates will be moving out early/mid June.<br>\n<br>\nIf interested please email with a little bit about yourself and a link to any social media is a plus.<br>\n<br>\nBest of luck on your search.    </section>"

Me and my roommate are staying and need to find 2 others to fill rooms for $775 $850. Utilities range from $50-$75/month but depend on season and usage.<br>\n<br>\nWe're 420 friendly/social drinkers, prefer the party to be kept outside of the home (apt is too 'cozy' for more than like 5 ppl) but totally cool having friends over/sleepovers just not like alloooooot. Like to keep the home cozy, clean, and comfortable and would like to find others that are into a \"family vibe\", like if someone else's dishes are in the sink you don't mind washing or if the garbage needs to go out you'll take the initiative to do it, and if you have extra kale and cant finish it you'll share =) hahha<br>\n<br>\nLikes- tequila, open &amp; honest communication, fresh air, astrology (we're a virgo &amp; capricorn), Broad City, SVU marathons, that moment when you step onto the subway platform and the train arrives seconds later, cashmere, adventures, &amp; good vibes. <br>\n<br>\nDislikes- door slamming, passive aggressiveness, filth, heavy walkers, indoor cigarette smoking, most reality TV, laziness, &amp; when cabinet doors are left open and main lights aren't turned off. Would like to have roommates that are capable of paying rent/utilities in a timely manner and to communicate any issues so that there's no passive aggressiveness or petty actions. <br>\n<br>\nThe apt is a 4bd/2bath in bedstuy BK off Myrtle-Willoughby G train maybe a 10-15 min walk from Myrtle JM trains. Located next to a community garden, block away from laundromat and about 2 blocks from grocery store. Coffee shops, restaurants, bars and cute shops are all within walking distance and home depot is super close too if you're into that (i am lol) <br>\n<br>\nNeed to commit to a year lease starting June 2017 and able to pass credit check, provide proof of income and pay first/last/security deposit to move in.    </section>"

Must be able to sign a one year lease with me (your only roommate) starting June 1st. No pets. No smoking.<br>\n<br>\nSunny, prewar, top floor apartment (of a 3 story walkup) with original architectural details, wood floors, and high ceilings. Located on a very quiet residential street near Prospect Park. Close to a wide array of grocery stores, good restaurants/bars, and cute coffee shops. Less than a 5 minute walk to the 7th Ave stop on the F/G. Awesome location! The room is bright and cheery with 2 large windows! There is no closet directly in the room, but a large closet in the adjoining living room will be yours to use! $1225 per month + utilities (about $75 per month per person).Your roommate will be a female graphic designer in her mid-twenties working for an agency in Manhattan.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou should be gainfully employed, a nonsmoker, and should be able to comply with a strict no pet policy (as requested by my landlord). You should be responsible, considerate/clean in shared spaces, and you should generally avoid \"bringing the party home\". Must have good credit (credit check required). Must be able to provide proof of employment. Must be able to sign a year lease. Also, there will be a partial broker fee in addition to the first month's rent and security deposit (because my landlord feels more comfortable going through a broker for paperwork and background/credit check). So to move in, it would be $1225 (first month's rent) + $1225 (security deposit) + $1000 (partial fee). My landlord will also have to personally approve you!<br>\n    </section>"

Honestly, we love our apartment and it's in a really great location. I'm looking for one person to take her place! <br>\n<br>\nABOUT YOUR NEW APARTMENT: <br>\n<br>\n-\tAt the corner of 125 and Broadway in Morningside/West Harlem. <br>\n-\tA (literal) minute away from the very reliable 1 train and about ten minutes from the ABCD. <br>\n-\tIf buses are your thing we have those, too. Outside of our front door is the M4 and M104 for easy access to the east side. The M60 is five minutes away, making getting to Queens (and LGA) super convenient. <br>\n-\tRiverside Park and the beautiful Hudson River pier are minutes away. <br>\n-\tFairway Market is a 6-minute walk and C-Town and Duane Reade are even closer. <br>\n-\tWe sit above many restaurants and bodegas. Starbucks moved a couple of doors down a couple of months ago. A new cocktail bar opened up recently (their pineapple cider is to die for), Jin Ramen is down the block, there is a killer juice/ health food store right downstairs, and Dino BBQ is also very close. <br>\n-\tThere are also tons of great food/ bar/ grocer options on Amsterdam ave, only a five minute walk away.<br>\n- There are two laundry services as well as a laundromat within two blocks of the apartment. <br>\n-\tColumbia is a ten minute walk away!<br>\n-\tThe room has a window, a pretty spacious closet, and could fit a twin or full bed. <br>\n-\tThe rent is $1,100/month. Utilities generally run around $100/month per person. It's a little higher during the summer. <br>\n<br>\nI AM:<br>\n<br>\n-\tA 25-year-old female, usually gone between 12:00 PM &amp; 8:00 PM, M-F. <br>\n- A poet and recently got my MFA from NYU. <br>\n-\tOften ghostlike (ask my current roommate), so often it'll feel as if you have the apartment to yourself. <br>\n-\tPretty laid back and I like to bake cookies. <br>\n-\tOpen to having friends over! <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTO MOVE IN: <br>\n<br>\n-\tYou'll need a sense of humor plus $2,200 (first month &amp; security). <br>\n-\tTo sign onto the lease (which, is necessary) you have to prove your income (they like ~$60,000/year) or have a guarantor to back you. <br>\n-\tThe move in is for June 1st or ASAP.<br>\n-\tWe are looking to show the apartment on this Sunday afternoon (or sometime next week if Sunday doesn't work for you!). Please shoot me a message to set this up. We look forward to hearing from you! :)<br>\n    </section>"

We're looking for two new tenants to sign a one-year lease and move into our fantastic, sunny 5-bedroom, 2.5 bathroom Upper West Side apartment on June 1st. True private bedrooms...no fake walls or anything. Large living room, huge kitchen, laundry in the building, live-in super. The common areas are completely furnished.<br>\n<br>\nThe two tenants moving out are one girl and one guy, moving out of the area or in with a significant other. The original leaseholders signed the lease more than 10 years ago and it's been passed down throughout the years. It's truly a hidden gem in Manhattan. I love this place and you will, too.<br>\n<br>\nThe bedrooms each have a tall closet, large window and can hold a queen size bed and a dresser comfortably. <br>\n<br>\nThe apartment is located on the corner of West 96th and Broadway, a 30-second walk to the 1-2-3 express trains: a 5-minute ride to Times Square, 8-minute ride to 14th Street, and 15-minutes to Wall Street. You'll be at 30 Rock in about 10 minutes! We've got all the major banks within a one block radius, Westside Market one block away, and Whole Foods 3 blocks away. We're right between Central Park and Riverside Park. <br>\n<br>\nYour rent will be $1,350 plus utilities (cable/wifi/electric)<br>\n<br>\nThe roommates: all three are young professionals in our mid/late-20's working in media. We like to have a good time but don't bring the party home. The females share one bathroom and the males share another, so there's never any awkward interactions.<br>\n<br>\nWe love this place and we're looking forward to welcoming you into our home! Please reach out with a brief bio and a link to your Facebook/LinkedIn profile.    </section>"

We do have some basic rules<br>\n about keeping the common spaces clean after use, and have a<br>\n weekly rotating chore wheel for taking out trash and<br>\n recycles and keeping the bathroom and kitchen tidy. We're busy folks working on our stuff, but we like to enjoy each other's company from time to time as well. The kitchen is yours to use, and cookware is shared. There is no laundry in the building.<br>\n<br>\n Our building is a 10-minute walk from the main Columbia campus,<br>\n and near the 1 train at 125th st, and A/C/B/D lines.<br>\n We're also close to MSM, UTS, and JTS, and many nice<br>\n restaurants and parks are nearby.

It is $1300 a month, all utilities included. Here is a description:<br>\nThis is a large, open studio basement apartment in Astoria, off the N/Q Astoria Blvd stop. This apartment has it's own entrance as well as its own air conditioning unit. There is plenty of storage space between the sliding closet and the empty chest of drawers. The furniture is included in the sublet, so all you would need is your own towel and some blankets. All utilities are included in the price of the rental including internet. If you are a musical person, or if you aren't, there is a full/fully weighted keyboard in the apartment for your enjoyment. There is recessed lighting throughout as well as tile flooring through the whole apartment. Couples are welcome, but unfortunately animals are not. No smoking in the apt. Everything in the kitchen is available for use. This is right near Astoria Park, less than 5 minutes from the Beer Garden as well as many other bars, cafes, shops, pharmacy's, and everything you can need. Laundry is not in the building but is right around the corner. This is 15 minutes from Times Square on the Subway and overall one of the safest neighborhoods you can be in!    </section>"

Friendly, clean, respectful, fun, and welcoming. We sometimes hang out together in the living room listening to music or go out for dinner, but also value personal space. Some of us are night owls but respect others' early wake up times. No cleaning schedule but we maintain a pretty high level of cleanliness. Things don't sit out longer than a day and we all pitch in to keep things tidy. No pets (sorry), no cigarettes, no heavy drug use.<br>\n<br>\nLet me be real with you:<br>\nThis apartment would be perfect for a grad student or young professional who likes all of the above, cares about meshing well with housemates, has their own life going on, and isn't hypersensitive to noise (wrong city if you are). Living so close to the train station and Broadway is convenient, but expect to hear it. Honestly though, I barely notice it anymore. Just an fyi.<br>\n    </section>"

The room can easily fit a double or queen, although a double would probably be best suited for the space. The closet for this room is our walk-in coat closet, which is right across from one of the bedrooms and next to the bathroom door. You will be sharing a bathroom with one of the girls, there is a second bathroom with a shower in the master bedroom. Pictures are attached of the apartment, room and closet. <br>\n<br>\nRent is $1235. Move-in fees will include a security deposit - $167, amenity fee - $350, and fee for leasing the fake wall - $50 Monthly bills usually end up netting out to be:<br>\n<br>\n$44.00 per month for TV<br>\n$30-40 per month for electric/gas<br>\n*Sometimes it has been as low as $13, and as high as $50<br>\n$20 per month for water<br>\n<br>\n77 Park is an elevator building and has great amenities, including a doorman, on-site gym, laundry room, 3rd floor sun deck with grills, and in-house dry cleaning services. The building in a great location - close to downtown (can be at a nail salon, small market, and a bar within 4-5 minutes of walking) and a 5-7 minute walk to the PATH train.<br>\n<br>\nLooking for someone that is respectful, relatively low-key, and organized. My roommate and I do go out quite often, but don't normally host parties or pre-games in our apartment and would expect the same of our roommate. I am a dietitian working in NYC; usually out the door at 7 am and return home by 6pm.  I sometimes work weekends. My roommate works as an accountant and is usually out the door at around 9am and returns home after 7:30/8pm.<br>\n    </section>"

Acme, laundry mat, liquor store, pizza, Chinese, Spanish and Indian food are all around the corner, as well as a beautiful view of Manhattan and the river at the end of the block, good for relaxing views, or runs/walks.  You will be getting 2 rooms.  Since they are smaller than the other 2 bedrooms, most people use one for sleeping, and the other as an office, storage, etc.  We are on the second floor of a walk-up with a large living room we share(roughly 27'x12'), as well as a bathroom and kitchen.  We also have a backyard area good for lounging in the warm weather, or having a few friends over for a bbq.  The neighbors downstairs are a very friendly, and will occasionally meet up for some food/drinks.  The living room has a different tv, rug, paint and table in it now.  Just haven't taken a more recent pic.<br>\n<br>\nWe try to keep the place clean, obviously it's up to us to keep the place in order, so if you're looking for others to pick up after you, then this is not the place for you.  We all have our lazy days, nights of too much drinking, and so on, making/leaving a mess happens.  We have no problem with that, as long as if it's not a consistent thing, or is left for periods of time.  We are both male, I am 36, a Graphic Designer/Artist by trade, and your other roommate is 33, and works at a restaurant.  If you are in your 20's - 30's, neat, have a job, are conscientious of other peoples things, laid back and pretty much easy going, then this is a good place for you.  Hanging out in the living room watching a game, having a few beers, listening to music, maybe even a game of something is not unheard of.<br>\n<br>\nRent and security are paid to the landlord, although utilities are not included with the rent fee.  We are looking for someone to be in for June.  Feel free to email with any questions you may have, and to set up a time to view the place.    </section>"

There is a nice open living room with a large couch and love seat (often occupied by our two friendly cats), and an eating area with table and some chairs. The kitchen has tons of counter space courtesy of a bar that divides it from the living room space, and is well-stocked with gear (food processor, blender, cookware etc.). There are beautiful parquet floors and lots of nice little pre-war touches like lovely moulding, tile work, and a stained-glass window in the bathroom.<br><br>\nWe're one block away from the Q train, which can get you over the bridge to Manhattan in twenty minutes. We're also a two-minute walk from glorious Prospect Park's southeast corner- close to the 60-acre lake and the swans, ducks, egrets that live there as well as the more open spaces than one finds on the north side. Pretty much every amenity is within a block or two. There is a farmer's market on Sundays, a large supermarket a block away, a Duane Reade, laundromat, hardware store, discount housewares, jerk chicken, great cheap produce stands, coffee shops and bars.<br><br>\nAlthough we're near a major intersection, we're tucked away at the end of a funny little one-block residential dead-end street, so it's usually pretty quiet. The smallness of the street makes it conducive to neighbors getting to know one another. Several buildings have flower gardens going in the warmer months that have also been bringing the neighbors out more and more.<br><br>\nRoom is nice, approximately 15' x 8', with two windows. It is unusually shaped (a bit like the hull of a ship--wide at one end and narrower at the other), but can easily fit a full or queen bed, desk and/or dresser, and bookshelf. One entire wall of the room is closet space (!!!). It will be available for a June 1 move-in.<br><br>\nAbout us:<br><br>\nSays housemate 1: \"I'm a queer, white female in my early 30s. These days, I'm most excited about the musical, political, mindful-living communities/activities I'm a part of. I like to keep my life filled with opportunities to practice yoga, ride my bike, see live performances, &amp; eat at fun restaurants/cook for friends. I work a busy day job in Manhattan that keeps me out of the apartment during the day. I like my home to be a place where I can relax, kick my feet up, read a good book, and snuggle with my 2 sweet, affectionate kitties, and where my friends/roommates feel comfy too. I like being close to the Park, while having easy commute to surrounding Brooklyn neighborhoods.\"<br><br>\nSays housemate 2: \"I'm a straight-identified, queer-friendly lawyer/herbalist in my late 30s. I like to travel, read, dance, and connect with people and organizations re-imagining how we grow food, work, make home, and make meaning (permaculture, cooperatives, gift economies, restorative justice etc.). Investing in community is an important aspect of my life, and having a harmonious home is part of that. When I'm not working, you can find me walking in Prospect Park, hosting potlucks, singing (I'm in a choir), or planning a trip that will get me as far out of the city and off-the-grid as possible.\"<br><br>\nWe are laid-back and kind, respectful of private space but happy to be around one another when we're home. We frequent food coops and farmers markets and are open to sharing food staples when practical, as well as meals when we happen to all be home. We also enjoy unwinding on the couch or stoop, having a beer, and sharing the ups and downs of life in the big city. We keep the apartment relatively clean and are non-smokers. We have a month-to-month lease, but are hoping for someone who would like to join us and settle in for a while. While we love our two cats, we don't have space for more pets.<br><br>\nRent is $750/month, heat included. Utilities (electric, cooking gas, internet) generally run about $40/month per person. <br><br>\nCare to join our home?<br><br>\nTell us a little about yourself!<br><br>\n(Pictures above show the stoop, common areas, room for rent, and the view of the lake at our corner of Prospect Park.)    </section>"

I am a 28 year old female who is currently living with a 25 year old gay male. We are looking to rent out the other bedroom in our 3 bedroom Upper East Side apartment. The room is a conversion without windows, however, is under $1,000 on the Upper East Side! The room price is $967/month not including utilities. Utilities are usually $50-70/month per person.  It is located in a great location steps away from the new Second Avenue Q train and also close to the 4,5,6 line. We are both low-key and relaxed, love our own space, and have busy schedules. We are looking for a responsible, respectful, and clean roommate to sign a June 1st 1 year lease.    </section>"

It is one bedroom in a three bedroom apartment, with shared kitchen and bathroom. The room is sizable (roughly 12'x7') with a huge closet, and a nice n' sunny window that looks out onto 2nd Ave.<br><br>\nMove-in requires May's rent and a $1300 security deposit, which will be returned in full at the end of July barring any damages to the property. Rent is to be paid either through Chase QuickPay or Venmo. Internet and utilities run on average $50/month per person. (They tend to increase a bit in summer when the roomies run their AC's.)<br><br>\nAs the other current housemates will be traveling/moving out in June and July, there will be a bit of a roomie-shuffle. <br><br>\nIf you have further questions or are interested, please call/text me at \n <a href=\"/fb/nyc/sub/6108031082\" class=\"showcontact\" title=\"click to show contact info\" rel=\"nofollow\">show contact info</a>\nand we can talk further/set up a viewing.<br><br>\nI will be showing the room next Tuesday evening, May 2nd. And next Wednesday, May 3rd, from early afternoon until 6 PM.<br><br>\n(To the grown potheads and blossoming alcoholics out there, this room is not for you I'm sad to say.)<br><br></section>"

The apartment is in a co-op that is very well maintained and really a great community. There are coin-operated washers/dryers in the basement and an elevator, but the apartment is on the 2nd floor. <br><br>\nThe apartment has one bathroom, a very large living room and a modern kitchen with a dishwasher in it, and plenty of cabinet/counter space. The apartment itself is not the biggest, but it's cozy and perfectly located. You have access to every subway line within a five-minute walk (Atlantic Avenue/Barclays), along with a C train stop on the block (Lafayette Avenue). Lastly, the G train Fulton St. stop is just a couple blocks away. Seriously, it's the perfect location. <br><br>\nAVAILABLE BEDROOMS: The first bedroom (larger of the two) can fit a full-size bed and wardrobe, has a large window that gets great light, and a big closet. It's also directly next to the bathroom. The second available bedroom is the smallest of the three rooms. It can fit a full-size bed and a wardrobe and that's about it. It does have two windows that also get great natural light. It is directly adjacent to the living room, but you'll have a full hallway closet to yourself. There is also lots of storage space available in the apartment, and there is a possibility for this specific room to be furnished. <br><br>\nABOUT ME: I'm a 28-year-old male originally from D.C. who works in television, so I tend to work loopy hours and days. On the weeknights I'm mostly home after 8 and love to unwind by watching TV or just chillin' out. Weekends I'm either in or out, but I love to entertain and have friends over when I can; nothing crazy. I'm very clean, respectful and expect the same from my roommates. FYI, I'm a major sports fan, specifically soccer and college sports.<br><br>\nThe rent is $1,100 a month, plus utilities/internet, which are not much (~$65/month). The lease runs through May 2018, with an option to extend. Room is available June 1st, 2017. <br><br>\nSerious inquiries only. Please respond with the subject line saying, \"Brooklyn is dope!\" so I can make sure you're not a bot :) Also, please send links to social media pages. Any additional questions, please ask!<br><br>\nThanks    </section>"

We have all the things you need within 3 blocks: grocery stores, restaurants, bodegas, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and we're close to Maria Hernandez Park. <br><br>\nThe apartment is a 2bed/1bath first floor unit. Your bedroom faces the East, catching the morning sun, but can be easily blocked out if that is your thing. The room comes fully furnished (including A/C)! It has a private entrance to our private back yard (where a table and chairs are set up and occasionally our hammock). We will have lots of little plants growing out there =) <br><br>\nThe kitchen is our favorite room in the house. It is large enough for two people to be cooking simultaneously. There's a 5 burner gas stove, a dishwasher(!), and it is fully equipped.<br><br>\nABOUT US:<br>\nOne of us is in school full time for web development, while the other works full time in early childhood education.<br><br>\nWe are in our late 20's and have been dating for over 5 years so you would have to be cool with all of the couple things (we promise not to be obnoxious, and we rarely fight). <br><br>\nIt would be great to hit it off and hang out occasionally, but will always respect your privacy. We enjoy cooking for people so we hope you like eating! <br><br>\nWe like to keep the house neat and tidy, uncluttered of people's personal items in the common areas and above all functional for everyone. We are pretty laid back but we put a lot of time and effort into making our home an awesome place to live, so we hope you will respect that.<br><br>\nThe only necessary traits we're looking for in a roommate are to be the following three C's: courteous, communicative, and clean. <br><br>\nLanguages spoken: English, Spanish, and \u5c11\u3057\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e =)<br><br>\nYOU:<br>\n...should be a respectful and responsible woman who is over the party phase(aka now adulting). You might be a morning person, and you don't mind living with meat eaters.<br><br>\nBonus points if you like gardening, reading copious amounts of books, and won't get mad if you lose at Settlers of Catan. Other stuff we might connect on: nutrition/functional medicine, computer programming, hiking, sustainability, traveling and meditation. <br><br>\nTHE RENT:<br>\n... is $1,050/month with utilities included (Internet, gas, and electricity). You will need to pay first month and a security deposit of $1,050 to move in ($2,100 in total). We ask for a one-month notice before you move out. You will not be on the lease, but will be asked to provide proof of income(you may also be asked to pass a credit check). Room is available beginning June 1st. <br><br>\nLast buzzkill section: no subletting, no couples, no smoking, and no pets(there's a dog park down the block though so it's cool). <br><br>\nWe hope that you'll be our new roommate! Please put \"Suydam Apartment\" in the subject line of your reply, and tell us a little about yourself.<br><br>\nThanks for looking,<br><br>\nMikie &amp; Alyssa<br></section>"

This is a 2 month sublet with a $500 subletting fee and you can extend the lease but this has to be through the realtor or management. It's summertime and this apartment will go fast.

The location is amazing, 2 blocks from the river, close to the park, Whole Foods, Duane Reade and tons of great bars and restaurants. The apartment itself is a recently renovated 3 bed that you'd be sharing with two women in their 20s. Both are super friendly and work full-time so they aren't around much.<br><br>\nThe room is furnished and the $1500 includes utilities, internet and cable TV. It's available from June 1st (or possibly a few days sooner) until the end of February 2018. Depending on what my roommates want to do at the end of the lease, there is the possibility to stay. <br><br>\nAbout you: employed, not messy, doesn't smoke inside, and always can pay rent on time. <br><br>\nSince this is a shared apartment, no couples and no pets (absolutely no exceptions, sorry).    </section>"

Our building requires a credit check as part of the application, which is $100 - but this cost is balanced by the $0 security deposit. <br><br>\nThe armoire in the room is available for $50, and the night stand and a small book case can be left for you if you'd like them. <br><br>\nIf this description fits you and what you're looking for, please contact Natalie.

You see sky, stars, moon, you hear birds and dogs!  My Apartment is tastefully furnished with real-Antique furniture.  The clean Kitchen, Diningroom, and Bathroom are shared with a mature women who has two sweet dogs, and she is out working most of the day.  The dogs stay in her room, they do NOT ever go into your room. Room has AC, WIFI, a closet, Kitchen is fully outfitted, there is a part time doorman.<br><br>\n  This 3 month sublet is perfect for a responsible person doing a summer internship, moving to New York City, studying, medical residence at Columbia Hospitals which are right down the street, exploring New York, renovating their home.  It is NOT OK for someone coming to NYC to party (no drugs!), store a lot of boxes, or, have other pets.   The rent is $960 including the WIFI, there will be additional charges for the electricity depending on air conditioning costs.  Asking first month rent, and a second month rent as a deposit (terms to be discussed) , I have excellent recommendations from former summers.<br><br>\n  The room is for one person, however you are welcome to have guests come even for 1 week at a time as long as you discuss it with your roommate.  The L-shaped couch is actually two very comfortable , high quality mattresses.<br><br>\n   Washington Heights is a safe, Dominican family oriented neighborhood, with a lot of inexpensive food shops.  There is even a daily green market, and a weekly market which has the same vendors as downtown with much cheaper prices.<br><br>\n   A-express train is two blocks away, 17 min to Columbus Circle, 30 minutes to Union Sq. 40 min. to Wall Street financial district.  4 blocks away there is also the 1 train, and the C train.  <br><br>\n   Please e-mail me first with your questions and concerns, happy room searching!!!!!    </section>"

We're looking for a third roommate to join our converted 3-bedroom apartment. Our current roommate is moving in with her boyfriend at the end of May, so we're looking for someone to replace her on June 1. Our lease is up in October, but there's a possibility we'd renew and/or you could take over the lease.<br><br>\nAbout the room: it's a good-sized (for Manhattan!) bedroom that we set up in the far corner of our living room (2 walls are the living room corner (including a north-facing window that gets tons of light), 1 is a gigantic floor-to-ceiling shelving unit, and the 4th is a floor-to-ceiling curtain wall). We're super-respectful and low-key, so noise (given the curtain wall) has never become an issue with that room. The room comes furnished with a full bed, lamp, side table, and air conditioning unit in the window. <br><br>\nAbout the apartment: it's a pre-war (we think?) walk-up building in midtown east, with the E, M, and 6 right on our corner. The apartment is fully furnished and gets tons of natural light. There's also easy in-building laundry access downstairs. Utilities aren't included in the $1100 rent, but, on average, each of us usually pays around $30/month for electricity and $25/month for internet. We don't have cable, but we compensate for that successfully with Apple TV with Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, etc. :-)<br><br>\nAbout us: we're two mid/late-20s women, both working full-time (roughly 9:30-7, M-F) in digital media. We met as craigslist roommates and became good friends, and are looking for someone who's a great personality fit as well--having a comfortable and respectful home vibe is really important to us. We're laid-back, friendly and active (we don't spend much time in the apartment) and we're looking for the same in a new roommate. When we're home, it's usually to cook, watch a movie/show (we just finished Big Little Lies and Girls together), read, or just hang out and chat. We're clean and respectful of common areas, don't ever \"bring the party home,\" etc.<br><br>\nIf you're interested, please reply to this ad and tell us a bit about yourself (name, age, where you're from, occupation, routine, when you'd want to move in/how long you'd want to stay, any habits we should know about, questions you have for us, etc), and we'll get back to you!    </section>"

Common paper products and soap are purchased by one of our roommates monthly, and then she adds that amount to the monthly utilities bill.<br><br>\n The people who usually live here are: <br><br>\nFemale, 30, writer/editor/writing instructor <br><br>\n Female, 27, grad student at Columbia in Modern Art (curatorial studies) <br><br>\n Female, 22, undergraduate student in home products at FIT.<br><br>\nThe 30 yr old will definitely be around all summer, and the other two will be in and out. All three of us will be back in August.<br><br>\nThe room has a lot of natural light and our current roommate's furniture is available for sale.<br><br>\nThe vibe in our place is relaxed, laid back, kind and respectful, you should be too! We do have some basic rules about keeping the common spaces clean after use, and have a weekly rotating chore wheel for taking out trash and recycles and keeping the bathroom and kitchen tidy. We're busy folks working on our stuff, but we like to enjoy each other's company from time to time as well. The kitchen is yours to use, and cookware is shared. There is no laundry in the building.<br><br>\n Our building is a 10-minute walk from the main Columbia campus,<br>\n and near the 1 train at 125th st, and A/C/B/D lines.<br>\n We're also close to MSM, UTS, and JTS, and many nice<br>\n restaurants and parks are nearby. The area is very safe--our<br>\n block has 24-hour security guards.<br><br>\n Please tell us something about yourself in your response.<br>\n Looking forward to hearing from you!

I'm looking for someone for June 1st.<br><br>\nI'm looking for someone very easy going, reliable, and down to earth. If you are financially stable and have a busy life of your own, that is a huge bonus.<br><br>\nI'm am a 32 male who is very mindful, respectful, and down to earth. I am in the music field. I have a pretty busy life, so hoping to find someone with the same and understands that. <br><br>\nThe apartment is off the Morgan stop on the L train, about an 7-8 minute walk from the train on a very peaceful street. It is about a 12-14 minute train ride to Union Square. It is also about a 10 minute walk to the J and M myrtle/broadway stop. The neighborhood is great, a little gritty, but has many great restaurants and bars such as Roberta's, Momo, Tutu's, 3 diamond door, Shinobi Ramen, Brooklyn Natural, Northeast Kingdom, and lots of young people. <br><br>\nThe place is really nice and spacious and the 2 bedrooms are on opposite ends of the apartment, which is great for privacy and chillness for everyone. Your bedroom will be unfurnished when you move in. It could easily fit a full sized bed, dresser, desk, and more. It's a nice size. Looking for someone potentially longterm, but to keep things relaxed we can start at 2-3 months and go from there.<br><br>\nThe rent will be $1,225. We would of course split utilities which will include electricity, internet, and heat/hot water, which is normally about $85-$100. In the heart of the summer and winter it can get a little more expensive. For moving in, I ask for 1 months rent and 1 months deposit.<br><br>\nIf this sounds like the right place for you, send me a message with some info about yourself, etc. Thanks so much!!<br></section>"

There is a sublet out in my beautiful apartment for $610 with a one month security deposit (utilities are all included). The room will be available from June 1- August 31. Dates can be adjusted but preference will be given to someone who can stay the full time. As the apartment already has 4 women, preference will also be given to a woman.<br><br>\nThe Room:<br>\nThe rooms only downfall is that it lacks a window to the outside. It has an air shaft window that can be opened but previous roommates haven't used it much. Currently the room has a twin sized bed but it can fit a full sized bed as well. We are still currently working out whether the room will be furnished so please keep that in mind when applying. You may need to bring your own bed. There will be an IKEA wardrobe in the room that can be used for a closet. Please see attached pictures! <br><br>\nATTENTION: We do have a cat. Her name is Peach and she is a snuggling kitty. We recently adopted her from the shelter. She is 7 years old. For this reason; we cannot accept anyone who currently has pets. And you must LOVE cats not just tolerate them because we expect you to be kind to our kitty. <br><br>\nMy Roommates:<br>\nI have 4 roommates, all with their own bedrooms. You will have your own private bedroom within the apartment. They are all in their 20s. <br><br>\nThe Apartment:<br>\nThe apartment is fully furnished and has two bathrooms. We split the bathrooms up between all of us but as one of them has a tub and the other has a stand up shower you are more than welcome to use which one you prefer. As you will be replacing me your \"home bathroom\" will be the one with the stand up shower. The apartment has a couch, table, TV, wifi, all the necessities and plenty of plates, bowls, forks, cooking utensils, etc. The apartment has been totally gut renovated with high end finishes, hardwood floors, tons of sunlight from windows, separate stainless steel kitchen with dishwasher. There is a washer and dryer in the basement that you can use but the washer it is not always the greatest. We have a great laundromat around the corner (a 2 minute walk), so we all prefer to use that.<br><br>\nThe Area:<br>\nLocated in the hip and artsy pocket of Mott Haven, the new \"Williamsburg\" of NYC. One train stop out of Manhattan right after 125th street on the 4, 5, 6 lines. Home to many artists and professionals alike. Insane square footage, artsy neighborhood, safe, with close proximity to Manhattan. 15-20 min train ride to Union square on the 4,5,6 lines. With Manhattan-ish restaurants and cafes, the vibe of this budding area is Long Island City/Wlliamsburg meets East Village!!\"<br><br>\nSound like this is for you? Email with:<br>\n1. The dates you would like to sublet<br>\n2. If you have the $610 total and security deposit<br>\n3. A little bit about yourself<br>\n4. Link to a social media profile if available    </section>"

There is a sublet out in my beautiful apartment for $610 with a one month security deposit (utilities are all included). The room will be available from June 1- August 31. Dates can be adjusted but preference will be given to someone who can stay the full time. As the apartment already has 4 women, preference will also be given to a woman.<br><br>\nThe Room:<br>\nThe rooms only downfall is that it lacks a window to the outside. It has an air shaft window that can be opened but previous roommates haven't used it much. Currently the room has a twin sized bed but it can fit a full sized bed as well. We are still currently working out whether the room will be furnished so please keep that in mind when applying. You may need to bring your own bed. There will be an IKEA wardrobe in the room that can be used for a closet. Please see attached pictures! <br><br>\nATTENTION: We do have a cat. Her name is Peach and she is a snuggling kitty. We recently adopted her from the shelter. She is 7 years old. For this reason; we cannot accept anyone who currently has pets. And you must LOVE cats not just tolerate them because we expect you to be kind to our kitty. <br><br>\nMy Roommates:<br>\nI have 4 roommates, all with their own bedrooms. You will have your own private bedroom within the apartment. They are all in their 20s. <br><br>\nThe Apartment:<br>\nThe apartment is fully furnished and has two bathrooms. We split the bathrooms up between all of us but as one of them has a tub and the other has a stand up shower you are more than welcome to use which one you prefer. As you will be replacing me your \"home bathroom\" will be the one with the stand up shower. The apartment has a couch, table, TV, wifi, all the necessities and plenty of plates, bowls, forks, cooking utensils, etc. The apartment has been totally gut renovated with high end finishes, hardwood floors, tons of sunlight from windows, separate stainless steel kitchen with dishwasher. There is a washer and dryer in the basement that you can use but the washer it is not always the greatest. We have a great laundromat around the corner (a 2 minute walk), so we all prefer to use that.<br><br>\nThe Area:<br>\nLocated in the hip and artsy pocket of Mott Haven, the new \"Williamsburg\" of NYC. One train stop out of Manhattan right after 125th street on the 4, 5, 6 lines. Home to many artists and professionals alike. Insane square footage, artsy neighborhood, safe, with close proximity to Manhattan. 15-20 min train ride to Union square on the 4,5,6 lines. With Manhattan-ish restaurants and cafes, the vibe of this budding area is Long Island City/Wlliamsburg meets East Village!!\"<br><br>\nSound like this is for you? Email with:<br>\n1. The dates you would like to sublet<br>\n2. If you have the $610 total and security deposit<br>\n3. A little bit about yourself<br>\n4. Link to a social media profile if available    </section>"

The room is the loft on the 10th floor of a duplex, the penthouse of the building. It has its own private bathroom and entryway across the hallway from the elevator. This is for a temporary sublet: June 1-August 31. <br><br>\nThe apartment has:<br><br>\n-2 Balconies with western &amp; southern exposures<br>\n-2 Full Bathrooms<br>\n-Floor to ceiling windows throughout the unit<br>\n-Washer &amp; Dryer in the unit<br>\n-Dishwasher<br>\n-Stainless steel appliances<br>\n-Large closets and storage space<br>\n-Open, furnished, common rooftop with 360 degree views of NYC<br>\n-Central Heating and Cooling!<br>\n-Onsite parking available (at additional cost)<br>\n-Apartment is just blocks from Astoria Park &amp; the East River<br><br>\nIf you don't know Astoria, we can tell you all about it. Astoria is a thriving neighborhood, close to some of New York's finest restaurants and bars, including the Bohemian Beer Garden and supermarkets within blocks.<br><br>\nMatt (me), I am 34 years old, I am laid back, social, extrovert, who works in technology, dabbles in condo sales, and enjoys running, biking, hip hop dance and the occasional NPR, Radiolab, TED talk.<br><br>\nJamie, 30 years old, also laid back, creative, artistic, who works as a mobile product manager in ad tech. We both dig watching Netflix, sampling beers and running. <br><br>\nWe both have 9-6pm jobs. So our hours are kind of standard.  Neither of us party a lot, but we would consider the occasional fiesta.  We will have the occasional friend over. We are clean, but not anal retentive. Rent is $1133 and we pay gas and electric split 3 ways at worst it can come out to $150 additional per person (the disadvantage of having AC). <br><br>\nIf you are interested, please tell us something about your life, hobbies, where you work. We are looking forward to meeting you.  We are showing the room in the evenings of Monday, May 1 and Tuesday, May 2.    </section>"

Our apartment is huge, with two bathrooms and a full living room.  The room available is good sized, with a large window and offers a lot of privacy.  You could easily fit a full/queen bed, dresser, desk or couch.  You would be living with two ladies and one gent, sharing a bathroom with 1 female roommate.  Roommates are all friendly professionals- working in chemistry, interior design, and education- and we keep a tidy but relaxed home.  The place has hardwood floors throughout, a comfy living room, kitchen with a dishwasher, and the two bathrooms are a real plus. The building has an elevator, and is in a wonderful neighborhood where we have many pals, and two community gardens on our street. <br><br>\nWe are very close to the 1, the A/C and the B/D trains so you can get just about anywhere in Manhattan in about 30mins. <br><br>\nRent is 800 + utilities (usually about $35/mo, including internet). Security deposit is 1 month's rent. <br><br>\nIf you're interested let me know a little about yourself and when you're free to check the place out.<br></section>"

Hardwood floors, large kitchen, unbelievably huge and luxurious bathroom. In the most happening, prime location in Greenpoint, with amazing boutiques, bars, restaurants, The Garden health food store, two easily walkable chain grocery stores, basically every amenity you could wish for. Just a quick block and a half walk to the subway. Laundromat directly across the street. We are looking for a truly quiet, clean, respectful roommate. This is a private internal room and has a window over the door to an adjacent sunny room to let in some sunlight. The kitchen and bathroom are the only shared common space, so it's perfect for those looking for a sanctuary after work, with a sense of having your own space in a no drama environment. Please don't respond if you're a musician (who practices audibly at home,) if you tend to spend an inordinate amount of time in the kitchen, or if you have a boyfriend/girlfriend who'd be spending the night frequently; we want someone quiet who socializes mostly outside of the apartment.    </section>"

I'm subletting one bedroom in a 3 BR/1 BA apartment located on the border of Park Slope and Gowanus. The room is available June 1 and I'm asking for a minimum term of 3-6 months, with the option to extend at the end of our term. I have lived in this apartment for 5 years and absolutely love the neighborhood. We're 2 blocks from the F/G/R trains and we're close to: restaurants/bars on 5th Avenue, Whole Foods, buses to Red Hook, the legendary Four and Twenty Blackbird pie shop, and lovely Prospect Park.<br><br>\nThe Room is cozy but has ample space for a full-sized bed and dresser and has a massive closet with storage above. It can fit a Queen bed but that might not leave room for a dresser/extra floor space. My former roommate is offering to sell her full-sized bed for a reasonable price; please let me know if you're interested. The room has one north facing window that gets lovely light throughout the day.  <br><br>\nThe Apartment is furnished and has hardwood floors throughout, including the bedrooms. We have a decent-sized kitchen that's fully stocked but we would welcome any additional items you'd like to bring.<br><br>\nThe Roommates are 2 twenty-something ladies: one works in the film festival circuit, the other works in nonprofit. We keep to different schedules but we're very low-key, warm, and friendly. When our schedules happen to align we like to share a beer or glass of wine but we don't bring the party home.  <br><br>\nI've had great roomie relations over the last 5 years and I'm really hoping to keep things that way. Looking for someone who has has mastered the skill of buying toilet paper when it's his/her turn. No smoking please and no pets (unfortunately). <br><br>\n$875 per month covers rent, heat, utilities, and internet. I ask for first and last month's rent to move in (total: $1750) and a signed short-term sublease starting June 1. Please send me a little bit about yourself and we can set up a time to come view the place. Thanks!    </section>"

There is a nice open living room with a large couch and love seat (often occupied by our two friendly cats), and an eating area with table and some chairs. The kitchen has tons of counter space courtesy of a bar that divides it from the living room space, and is well-stocked with gear (food processor, blender, cookware etc.). There are beautiful parquet floors and lots of nice little pre-war touches like lovely moulding, tile work, and a stained-glass window in the bathroom.<br><br>\nWe're one block away from the Q train, which can get you over the bridge to Manhattan in twenty minutes. We're also a two-minute walk from glorious Prospect Park's southeast corner- close to the 60-acre lake and the swans, ducks, egrets that live there as well as the more open spaces than one finds on the north side. Pretty much every amenity is within a block or two. There is a farmer's market on Sundays, a large supermarket a block away, a Duane Reade, laundromat, hardware store, discount housewares, jerk chicken, great cheap produce stands, coffee shops and bars.<br><br>\nAlthough we're near a major intersection, we're tucked away at the end of a funny little one-block residential dead-end street, so it's usually pretty quiet. The smallness of the street makes it conducive to neighbors getting to know one another. Several buildings have flower gardens going in the warmer months that have also been bringing the neighbors out more and more.<br><br>\nRoom is nice, approximately 15' x 8', with two windows. It is unusually shaped (a bit like the hull of a ship--wide at one end and narrower at the other), but can easily fit a full or queen bed, desk and/or dresser, and bookshelf. One entire wall of the room is closet space (!!!). It will be available for a June 1 move-in.<br><br>\nAbout us:<br><br>\nSays housemate 1: \"I'm a queer, white female in my early 30s. These days, I'm most excited about the musical, political, mindful-living communities/activities I'm a part of. I like to keep my life filled with opportunities to practice yoga, ride my bike, see live performances, &amp; eat at fun restaurants/cook for friends. I work a busy day job in Manhattan that keeps me out of the apartment during the day. I like my home to be a place where I can relax, kick my feet up, read a good book, and snuggle with my 2 sweet, affectionate kitties, and where my friends/roommates feel comfy too. I like being close to the Park, while having easy commute to surrounding Brooklyn neighborhoods.\"<br><br>\nSays housemate 2: \"I'm a straight-identified, queer-friendly lawyer/herbalist in my late 30s. I like to travel, read, dance, and connect with people and organizations re-imagining how we grow food, work, make home, and make meaning (permaculture, cooperatives, gift economies, restorative justice etc.). Investing in community is an important aspect of my life, and having a harmonious home is part of that. When I'm not working, you can find me walking in Prospect Park, hosting potlucks, singing (I'm in a choir), or planning a trip that will get me as far out of the city and off-the-grid as possible.\"<br><br>\nWe are laid-back and kind, respectful of private space but happy to be around one another when we're home. We frequent food coops and farmers markets and are open to sharing food staples when practical, as well as meals when we happen to all be home. We also enjoy unwinding on the couch or stoop, having a beer, and sharing the ups and downs of life in the big city. We keep the apartment relatively clean and are non-smokers. We have a month-to-month lease, but are hoping for someone who would like to join us and settle in for a while. While we love our two cats, we don't have space for more pets.<br><br>\nRent is $750/month, heat included. Utilities (electric, cooking gas, internet) generally run about $40/month per person. <br><br>\nCare to join our home?<br><br>\nTell us a little about yourself!<br><br>\n(Pictures above show the stoop, common areas, room for rent, and the view of the lake at our corner of Prospect Park.)    </section>"

Dates are slightly negotiable at either end, but I'm looking for at least a full two months' sublet. The apartment gets a lot of light (lots of windows) and is recently renovated with all-new appliances and bathroom. The kitchen is fabulous and the living room is huge. Rent is $750 a month, plus 1/3 of the gas+electric. High-speed wifi internet included. The bedroom will be furnished with at least a full-size bed.<br><br>\nLooking for young-ish professionals or students who would get along with two female grad students as roommates. A very sweet and friendly dog also lives in the apartment. Shoot me a text if you're interested!    </section>"

We are a respectful and relatively quiet household inhabited by men and women in our 20s and 30s. We have a full kitchen, dining room, and living room on the main level and a second living room and small private backyard w/ fire pit on the lower level. Our neighborhood is home to many great cafes, restaurants, and bars. We are less than two blocks away from Ft.

Two west-facing windows provide great natural light. You would share the spacious downstairs bathroom with two other housemates. Jason is moving across the country for grad school, so a fully or partially furnished room is negotiable. $930/month<br><br>\n\"Elliot's Room\" measures 8.5' x 9' and is on the main floor, adjacent to the dining room. It has one window facing the backyard and features an attractive blue accent wall.

Cost to move in will be 1st months rent + 1 month security + one-time rental fee. Utilities and shared expenses are typically $50 to $80/mo. If interested, please send over a little information about yourself and let us know when you can come by to check out the space. We plan to begin showing the rooms on May 6 &amp; 7.    </section>"

All utilities are included. <br><br>\nMy two roommates who will continue living here are females between 25 and 30.

I really like them and the apartment and am sad to be leaving. <br><br>\nThe apartment is centrally located between the Central Ave M and Kosciusko subway stops, making it 5 minutes walking distance to each. The neighborhood is cute and quiet, which grocery stores, laundry, coffee shops, and restaurants nearby. <br><br>\nThis would be a lease takeover beginning June 1st for 2 months and then renewing for an additional year on August 1. A credit check is required. First months rent and security are needed upon signing the lease.<br><br>\nFeel free to message me if you are interested and would like to hear more or come see the place.

I am a 22 year old female looking for another female to apartment hunt with. I have a place in mind that is a 2 bedroom, 1 bath in downtown Hoboken (3rd and Bloomfield). Rent is $1100 (total rent is $2200 and I'm assuming we'll split 50/50) and includes heat and hot water. It is renovated with a newer bathroom (that we will share), hardwood floors, and the bedrooms are on opposite sides of the apartment. There is a 1 month broker fee so $1100 per person, as well as 1.5 months security deposit and $40 for a security check. Also open to looking at other places but would like to stay in the Hoboken area. <br><br>\nAbout me: I am easygoing, respectful, and very low-key. I am a bit of a homebody and generally keep to myself, but would love to hang out and watch TV or explore the local restaurants if you would like. I will be working at a startup so likely long hours. I'll probably only be home in the evenings and go to bed before midnight during the week. Every other weekend, I will be out of town visiting my boyfriend in DC and the other weekends, he will be with me in the apartment (or out and about checking out the city). We're both very polite, laid back, and non-partiers so this shouldn't affect you at all. <br><br>\nLooking for another female similarly low-key, won't bring the party home, easy to get along with, and clean. Would prefer a new graduate or young professional as well. Must be financially stable and responsible. No smoking, drugs, or pets please. <br><br>\nPlease contact me if interested! :)    </section>"

I'm in the market for a roommate, ideally a woman or a gay/queer man, for one room in my 2 bedroom apartment in the heart of Williamsburg for a June 1 move in. The room is $1275 per month. It is a small room for sure, about 6x10, but it's cozy and it fits a good deal. I lived in this room for six years and it fit a full bed, a dresser, a bookshelf, and a nightstand, for reference. The room is in the back of the apartment and looks out onto a lovely, quiet garden.<br><br>\nJust as a price reference point - the rooms in the back house on this property are the exact same size, but are $1500!! <br><br>\nI've lived here for seven years and it's a great apartment off the Bedford stop on the L. It's on the ground floor, it has a huge kitchen, a washer in the unit, and a really nice garden in the back with a table and chairs, perfect for drinking wine during the summer. I have a roku with hulu, netflix, amazon prime, hbo, starz, cinemax, and showtime on it that you're free to use. The location literally couldn't be better -- its 2 blocks from the Bedford L stop, around the corner from Smorgasburg (which just opened again for the season, hurray!), a block from the ferry and the river, and close to tons of great bars and restaurants. I've literally never had a bad meal in this neighborhood. We're seriously in the BEST location! :)<br><br>\nThere's only two other apartments in the building, and all the tenants are really nice and have also been in the building for several years.<br><br>\nI'm a 33 year old woman and work at Etsy in the legal department. I'm also a theater director/producer, meaning that if I'm not in rehearsal for something at night, I usually keep it pretty chill on the evenings.<br><br>\nI'm looking for someone in their 20's or 30's who just wants a nice, calm place to live. Someone who's got their own stuff going on, but might also want to hang out and watch Game of Thrones, or make fun of a lifetime movie with me. No smokers, no hard drug users.<br><br>\nYou would also be roommates with my cat, Dennis. He enjoys napping, watching birds in the garden, and knocking every toy he's ever been given under the stove.<br><br>\nIf you're interested, shoot me a message to tell me a little bit about yourself and send any relevant social media if you have it. :) I will be setting up appointments ASAP. Thanks!!<br></section>"

A little early to advertise but just in case someone is already looking for September - I am not available through the summer after the end of May so I would like to show the room now for September move in. STILL AVAILABLE IF POSTING IS UP. For male to share apartment with one other male - only myself. Upper West Side. Probably most ideal and convenient area in all Manhattan to live in for everything. The West 72nd Street/Broadway subway is right next door (#1, 2 and 3 trains). Very clean, quiet, comfortable, well-furnished private room. Medium size - about 11'x11'. Share extra large eat-in-kitchen (I use it very little) and bathroom with one person (myself). Layout of apartment provides excellent privacy for each person - the closest thing to living alone. The two sleeping areas are very far apart and totally independent with many enclosing doors, separate ways to enter, etc. Own cable TV, A/C, wireless internet available. Laundry in building. Excellent well-maintained elevator building. Ideal for professional or student (very convenient for Columbia) seeking quiet environment who does not have a lot with them. The room is very fully furnished already and couldn't accommodate more furniture. $1295/month plus one month security and half utilities, but cable TV included. Non-smoking, no pets. Please reply with a little about yourself if you like - working, student, etc. No photos available now. I'd like to show it to those available to see it personally as soon as possible in May.<br></section>"

The fourth bedroom is a large conversion room (see photos of how it currently looks along with some of the better/more professional stock photos of the complex that I pulled from online) in a newly renovated apartment (we are the first people to live here since the renovation). The three of us work full time and are very respectful of noise. The conversion room includes a large 8 foot closet with lots of closet space (the most close space in the apartment, in fact) as well as four large built in drawers and two large built in shoe racks that pull out. Each bedroom comes with it's own personal a/c unit so you can have it as cool or as warm as you'd like. This bedroom has the largest window in the apartment and overlooks East Village and if you squint your eyes enough on a clear day, you can see the Brooklyn Bridge.<br><br>\nOur apartment is:<br>\n5 minute walk to the L train (which is then only a 3 minute train ride to Union Square which transfers to just about every other line or a 3 minute train ride to Williamsburg/Bedford stop in the opposite direction)<br>\n12 minute walk to Union Square<br>\nSuper close to amazing restaurants, bars, unique stores<br>\nQuite literally less than a 2 minute walk to East Village<br>\nIs not on or near a street where noise is an issue (it's probably one of the most quiet parts of the city)<br>\nHas a secured entrance<br>\nLocated 1 block away from a super market, 3 blocks away from Trader Joe's, and 5 blocks away from Whole Foods (or you can just get delivery all the time, like us)<br>\nAmazing neighbors (seriously, we love our neighbors)<br>\nIn a really great apartment complex with a coffee shop, yoga studio, gym, library, ice rink in the winter, a large park, farmer's market on Saturdays, basketball courts, young families, etc.<br>\nFree parking<br><br>\nPlease make the email out to Kait with an interesting subject line.<br>\nSerious inquiries only. <br>\nPlease allow 24 hours for a response.    </section>"

I'm a female (30) looking for another female to share a room. I've been sharing the room with a friend for past two years, but she's moving out to a new apt. You could move in June 1st, or July 1st. The lease is until September 30th. Then, I will move out to live with my husband. You can choose to stay and sign the lease with Jackie (27) - (there would be 3 of us in the apt, total) at the end of September, or leave - up to you. If you choose to stay, you can have the room to yourself for $1650/mo, or share it with a friend/boyfriend... for $825 each. We split the cost of electricity &amp; internet (usually around $35/each/mo). We clean the apartment thoroughly every 2 weeks (we take turns). We are looking for a friendly, CLEAN and QUIET female roommate - no drama please! :) This is a 2BD apt on 5th floor of a walk-up building. You would share the larger room with me. Looking forward to hearing from you! Kamila<br></section>"

There will also be the option to resign on the lease for another year. <br><br>\nYou- My roommates are looking for a mid to late twenty something year old professional female to move in on 6/1 and staying until the lease is up on 9/30. You are friendly, responsible, tidy and respectful to the japartment common spaces. <br><br>\nThe roommates- My current roommates are awesome! Very friendly and respectful while in the apartment. Both roommates are employed full time with Monday to Friday jobs in the Accounting and Media industries. Both live very active and busy lives outside the apartment. Apartment vibe is very chill/relaxed on weeknights and quiet by 10pm. They do not bring the party home and except the new roommate to do the same. <br><br>\nThe apartment- huge 1bd/1ba that has been permanently flexed into a three bedroom with FULL walls/doors. Roomates share the living room, kitchen (w/ dishwasher!) and bathroom. Huge closet in living space is split between the two flex rooms. Unit is on a high floor of a very nice full service high-rise in the financial district. (AC, elevators, 24 hr doorman, gym, laundry in building and one of the best roof tops in the area) Close to many subway lines at Fulton Street. Cleaning and apartment costs (wifi, electric, household goods) are split evenly by 3 (no more than $60) <br><br>\nThe room- Room has huge windows and full flex walls/doors for privacy. Very pretty views of the World Trade Center. Photos currently show a queen-size bed and dresser. Large closet in common room is shared with one other roommate. <br><br>\nHouse keeping/additional information:<br>\n- 1 month rent + security deposit required ($1250 security to secure + $1250 due prior to move in) Electric in the summer months is approx $60pp due to AC. <br>\n- Seublease will run from 6/1 to 9/30 with option to resign a new lease with current roomates starting in October. <br>\n- Must have employment and be able to show income for approx 40x your portion of the rent. Sorry but no consigners. There is an online application (with fee) and approval process that must be followed. Management is strict on their requirements. <br>\n- You will be added to the unit as an occupant and will be considered an official resident of the building. I will also remain on the lease until the end. <br>\n- As a side note, I will be selling a bunch of furniture cheap, if interested. (Queen bedframe/mattress, dresser, desk/chair etc) <br><br><br>\nWe are looking to fill the room asap but really value the fit of the new roommate so serious inquiries only! Open house style viewing to see the space this Wednesday at 7pm and meet the roommates- If you are interested please respond to the posting with a little bit of background about yourself (profession, hobbies, lifestyle etc) and feel free to ask additional questions. <br><br>\nThanks!<br>\nNikki    </section>"

One of the best locations in Hoboken. Less than 10-minute walk to PATH, less than 30 seconds from the closest bus stop (goes directly to Port Authority Bus Terminal at 41st). One of the largest living room / kitchen / bedroom combinations you'll find in Hoboken.<br><br>\nWHO WE ARE: We are two single guys looking for a friendly, clean, and respectful new third roommate to join us immediately. We're on the 3rd floor of a 4-story walk-up. One of us works from home and the other works in the city. We've been in Hoboken for about six years. FIOS Fiber Internet with Roku Sling TV. Not huge into sports, although we'll tune into the occasional football game. Although we like to keep our kegerator stocked and hope that you're someone we can hang with, we're definitely out of the college phase (so, no ragers or loud late-night parties). <br><br>\nABOUT THE ROOM: The available room is the best room in the apartment with two closets, two windows and space to fit a queen size bed with desk and dresser comfortably (about 12x10). Wood floors. It is a corner room with one window on one wall and another window on the adjacent wall. It's non-street-side and also furthest from the living room (significantly less street noise and living room noise than the other two bedrooms). Rent is non-negotiable at $1300/month and security deposit is $650 required before move-in. Heat and hot water are included, but gas/electric/TV/internet utilities are about $70-$100 per month depending on the time of year. <br><br>\nLOOKING FOR: Must be clean, considerate, and share responsibility in keeping common areas (kitchen, bathroom, living room) clean and tidy. We prefer to keep the noise and guests to a minimum after 10PM Sun-Thurs and Midnight Thurs-Sat. No pets allowed and no smoking. Men preferred. No live-in girlfriends. Month-to-month. We require at least 6 month commitment and 2 months notice before you move out.<br><br>\nThose interested should e-mail us via Craigslist and include their phone number and resume. Must have a steady income and pay rent on-time.    </section>"

It is a two bedroom apartment with a great living room and kitchen.  While sizable, the setup is cozy, so I'm ideally looking for someone who is reasonably clean, respectful, communicative and down to hang. \"Party-like\" habits are cool by me  but no actual parties. <br><br>\n***AVAILABLE JUNE 1st! <br><br>\n***RENT IS 900$ per month.  Due the first of each month.<br><br>\n***This covers ALL UTILITIES, including WIFI and a television in the living room with Netflix, Hulu and HBO Now accounts, and an airconditioner in the livingroom for summertime.***<br><br>\nLocation: Conveniently located a brief 5 minute walk from 2,3,4,5,S Franklin Ave. Multiple bus lines close by.  station in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Under 15 minute walk from A/C line and Long Island Railroad station at Nostrand Ave. 30 minute subway ride to 42nd Street (Times Square or Grand Central). <br><br>\nI tend to judge location on whether or not it is a visually pleasing atmosphere for a walk. Brooklyn Museum, Botanical Gardens (free every Tuesday/before noon Saturday!), Prospect Park, and the Central Public Library are all within a 15-minute walk along the famous &amp; beautifully tree-lined Eastern Parkway from the apartment. Close to Prospect Heights, Park Slope. Nice coffee shops, laundry, restaurants, grocery stores, &amp; bars all within a 5 minute walk..  Many old, lovely brownstones, many opportunities for people watching. Easy to find street parking.<br><br>\nThe room: Unfurnished. Note that the photos of the bedroom when empty were taken without the overhead light turned on--lots of natural light!  The closet is a very decent size.  The room fits a full size bed comfortably.  A queen can work but it's not ideal given the architectural layout of the room.  If you are hoping to squeeze a king in there, forget it. There is a ceiling fan.<br></section>"

It is on a quiet street that is just a few minutes away from cool new restaurants and bars like Home Frite, Black Swan, Clementine Bakery, Stonefruit Espresso, and so much more. Location wise, it does not get any better than this!<br><br>\nRent: $1162.5/month + utilities (internet, gas, electricity ~$100/month)<br><br>\nAbout the apartment: The apartment is a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom, open floor plan with a kitchen and living area.  The apartment is located on the first floor which makes for a super easy move-in! The living room area will be mostly furnished and you will just need to worry about your room. Your room has a closet and enough room for a full bed, drawer and dek. There is a WASHER and DRYER in the building on the floor below.  No pets in the apartment allowed. There is one room available in this apartment and I am looking for one person to fill it.<br><br>\nMe: I am a 27 year old, female who teaches middle school. I have long hours and my general schedule goes from 6:30-7:00pm every day.  When I am home, I like to cook, read, watch TV, and have quiet time at home. I am an easy-going, fun person who enjoys being out in the city, seeing Broadway and comedy shows, trying new foods/restaurants and doing NY things, but also loves recharging at home. This means that I like my home to be peaceful, clean and uncluttered! <br><br>\nYOU: I am looking for a female roommate who is ideally in the same age range and a schedule similar to mine.  We don't need to be best friends but it'd be awesome if we became friends! You are ideally very clean (my current roommate and I have a weekly cleaning schedule), NOT a wild partyer, does NOT do drugs or smoke, and is a respectful human. Having a partner is totally okay as long as they are not over every day (am not looking for a third roommate). I would love to find a roommate who also appreciates having a home that is a quiet sanctuary and a place to decompress from the stresses of work! Basically, you're a good person, is clean and doesn't bring home drama.<br><br>\nPlease reply to this if you are interested and we can set up a quick meeting! This is for a July move in, as the current lease ends in June.    </section>"

The front of the first floor comprises the kitchen, living room, and dining room in an enormous open area loft style space and in the back are two bedrooms. The first floor bathroom will be used primarily by the roommate and any occasional guests.  Stairs separate the 2nd floor (my) bedroom and the second bathroom. The atmosphere in my home is open and relaxed. All rooms are individually heated, and are cable ready. All rooms are also fully furnished (except for the vacant bedroom). Utilities (including heat, hot water, electric and cable) are included in the price of rent.  <br><br>\nThe Neighborhood \u2028 <br>\nCrown Heights is a great neighborhood because it is quiet, safe, clean, fun and easily accessible to Eastern Parkway, St. Johns, Atlantic Avenue, and Fulton Street. The neighborhood has changed significantly since I initially moved in and continues to improve. Subway Stops include - Crown Heights, Utica on the 4 and Utica Ave on the A train. Main bus lines include: B46, B45, B15, and B65. Living here is easy with nearby Laundromats, cleaners, grocery stores and fitness centers in walking distance.  <br><br>\nYou <br>\nPlease contact us if you are an ideal candidate: professional, adult, financially and emotionally stable, clean, responsible, easy going, have cohabitated (well) with others in the past, friendly, and drama-free. Unfortunately, I don't allow cigarette smoke in the house. \u2028\u2028 <br><br>\nMe\u2028 <br>\nAgain, I am 1 professional native New Yorker in my mid 30s. I am laid back, friendly, independent and am looking for the same! \u2028 <br><br>\nSorry no pets or couples. <br><br>\nInterested?  <br>\nEmail me if you are available on to come see for yourself!  <br><br>\nRENTAL FEATURES<br>\nLiving room<br>\nDining room<br>\nStorage space<br>\nRange / Oven<br>\nRefrigerator<br>\nMicrowave<br>\nBalcony, Deck, or Patio<br>\nCable-ready<br>\nHigh-speed internet<br>\nHardwood floor<br><br>\nCOMMUNITY FEATURES<br>\nNew property<br>\nLoft layout<br>\nLEASE TERMS: 1st Month and Security Due upon move in.<br></section>"

I'm in the market for a roommate, ideally a woman or a gay/queer man, for one room in my 2 bedroom apartment in the heart of Williamsburg for a June 1 move in. The room is $1275 per month. It is a small room for sure, about 6x10, but it's cozy and it fits a good deal. I lived in this room for six years and it fit a full bed, a dresser, a bookshelf, and a nightstand, for reference. The room is in the back of the apartment and looks out onto a lovely, quiet garden.<br><br>\nJust as a price reference point - the rooms in the back house on this property are the exact same size, but are $1500!! <br><br>\nI've lived here for seven years and it's a great apartment off the Bedford stop on the L. It's on the ground floor, it has a huge kitchen, a washer in the unit, and a really nice garden in the back with a table and chairs, perfect for drinking wine during the summer. I have a roku with hulu, netflix, amazon prime, hbo, starz, cinemax, and showtime on it that you're free to use. The location literally couldn't be better -- its 2 blocks from the Bedford L stop, around the corner from Smorgasburg (which just opened again for the season, hurray!), a block from the ferry and the river, and close to tons of great bars and restaurants. I've literally never had a bad meal in this neighborhood. We're seriously in the BEST location! :)<br><br>\nThere's only two other apartments in the building, and all the tenants are really nice and have also been in the building for several years.<br><br>\nI'm a 33 year old woman and work at Etsy in the legal department. I'm also a theater director/producer, meaning that if I'm not in rehearsal for something at night, I usually keep it pretty chill on the evenings.<br><br>\nI'm looking for someone in their 20's or 30's who just wants a nice, calm place to live. Someone who's got their own stuff going on, but might also want to hang out and watch Game of Thrones, or make fun of a lifetime movie with me. No smokers, no hard drug users.<br><br>\nYou would also be roommates with my cat, Dennis. He enjoys napping, watching birds in the garden, and knocking every toy he's ever been given under the stove.<br><br>\nIf you're interested, shoot me a message to tell me a little bit about yourself and send any relevant social media if you have it. :) I will be setting up appointments ASAP. Thanks!!    </section>"

A wonderful room is available in a 3-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights from June 1st - October 31st with option to take over lease if interested. Price is $1,033/month plus internet which is $14.99/month. Heat and hot water included. Elevator and laundry in building. &lt;2min walk to the A, C, and 1...easy access to downtown! Pharmacy, grocery store, and restaurants all in walking distance. Very safe neighborhood. Near NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center and Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. You will be sharing the apartment with two female roommates. We are all very busy and hardly see each other so often times it does feel like you have your own place which is nice! I am moving earlier than planned, but love this apartment and am sad to leave! I can show anytime after 5:00pm M-F or anytime on the weekends. Please send me an email if interested or have any questions!    </section>"

Fortunately this being park slope it's easy to find something going on in the neighborhood and I try to catch a concert at the park or meetup with a friend when I can. I'm usually away 1 or 2 weekends per month. The rest of the time I like to snowboard, ride my motorcycle, hit the beach, or explore the city.  All in all as long as the bills are paid and we communicate well I'm pretty easy going.<br><br>\nAbout you:<br>\nEither a guy or girl who has done the NYC roommate thing before. A young professional who is responsible about paying the bills and enjoys having a clean place. Since we're going to be living together it'd be nice to sit down and watch a show or have a drink together once in a while. <br><br>\n1st month's rent and security required for move-in<br><br></section>"

The room is 11'8 x 11'6 with a decorative fireplace, a closet, 2 windows, and a hanging nook over the radiator.  The rent is 1400 with all utilities included, and cable/internet is 58 currently, so 1458 total.  <br><br>\nThe roommates: Currently there are two of us here who have lived with each other for 3 years now.  I am a 35 year old woman who went from fashion to nanny.  The other roommate is a 34 year old woman who is a marketing analyst.  We like to hang out together whether on our couch watching tv or sometimes out shopping and grabbing a bite to eat, but we also are respectful of each other's privacy.  We'd like someone who also wants a peaceful comfortable haven to call home!  Our first roommate together was a 26 year old guy in IT for two years, and our most recent guy roommate is a 27 year old PhD graduate who has stayed with us for one year.  We are open to both guys and girls though.  If you are open to having a very cute dog friend named Whiskey, 420 friendly, and like to be super clean, then we all will get along!!<br><br>\nThe apartment:  This is a 3rd floor walk-up with the kitchen and living room in the middle separated by a nice archway, and all three rooms on either end.  The bathroom is shared, but also is really big for NYC!  The first two pictures are of the bedroom, and the last two pictures are of the common area.<br><br>\nThe location:  Our location is super convenient being only a few stops from Manhattan, near most trains (A/C/F/G/2/3/4/5/R/Q), Barclay Center, Brooklyn Fare, Trader Joe's, Macy's, Michael's, and lots of other shopping and restaurants.  We are on the edge of Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn Heights, and Downtown Brooklyn.<br><br>\nIf you have any questions or would like to see the apartment, feel free to email me anytime, thanks!!!<br><br></section>"

The room is 11'8 x 11'6 with a decorative fireplace, a closet, 2 windows, and a hanging nook over the radiator. The rent is 1450 with all utilities included, and cable/internet is 58 currently, so 1508 total. <br><br>\nThe roommates: Currently there are two of us here who have lived with each other for 3 years now. I am a 35 year old woman who went from fashion to nanny. The other roommate is a 34 year old woman who is a marketing analyst. We like to hang out together whether on our couch watching tv or sometimes out shopping and grabbing a bite to eat, but we also are respectful of each other's privacy. We'd like someone who also wants a peaceful comfortable haven to call home! Our first roommate together was a 26 year old guy in IT for two years, and our most recent guy roommate is a 27 year old PhD graduate who has stayed with us for one year. We are open to both guys and girls though. If you are open to having a very cute dog friend named Whiskey, 420 friendly, and like to be super clean, then we all will get along!!<br><br>\nThe apartment: This is a 3rd floor walk-up with the kitchen and living room in the middle separated by a nice archway, and all three rooms on either end. The bathroom is shared, but also is really big for NYC! The first two pictures are of the bedroom, and the last two pictures are of the common area.<br><br>\nThe location: Our location is super convenient being only a few stops from Manhattan, near most trains (A/C/F/G/2/3/4/5/R/Q), Barclay Center, Brooklyn Fare, Trader Joe's, Macy's, Michael's, and lots of other shopping and restaurants. We are on the edge of Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn Heights, and Downtown Brooklyn.<br><br>\nIf you have any questions or would like to see the apartment, feel free to email me anytime with a little about yourself, thanks!!!    </section>"

We are looking for two roommates (female preferred) to move into two open bedrooms in our beautiful 5 bedroom/2 bath East Rock house. Both rooms are available starting July 1. The common areas are fully furnished and we have a dishwasher, free w/d in unit, plenty of storage, a big backyard and a grill. Utilities are split among all 5 roommates and range from $40 in the summer to up to $100 in the winter. The house is conveniently located in the residential East Rock neighborhood, walking distance to markets, restaurants and bars, as well as Science Hill/School of Forestry. We are on two routes of the Yale shuttle line (the blue and orange lines), one of which stops right in front of the house. <br><br>\nWe are three Yale affiliated women in our mid-twenties who have been in this house together for the past year and are sad but excited to see two of our roommates go off to graduate school. We are all friendly and active young professionals/students who work in research settings and are pretty busy, but keep a fun, clean and respectful home. We like wine and cheese, puzzles and pizza nights. Email us to learn about us/the house!    </section>"

Great! Because, I'm looking for a roommate to take over the second bedroom in my apartment! Interested so far? Excellent! I just have a few questions for you below:<br><br>\n-Are you professional? Do you have a steady job/source of income, and can pay your rent and utilities punctually and reliably?<br>\n-Are you sociable? Do you like to put your feet up at the end of a long day, crack open a beer and watch tv/play Xbox and shoot the breeze?<br>\n-Do you like to play music, and dance around the apartment in your underwear?<br>\n-Are you active? Do you like to do activities or go to the gym, or enjoy the sunshine whenever it happens to poke out through the clouds?<br>\n-Do you like strong drinks and strong coffee?<br>\n-Are you 420 friendly?<br>\n-Are you kind, considerate, and easygoing?<br>\n-Are you clean?<br><br>\nIf you answered yes to any of the above, then keep on reading!<br><br>\nI'm a 28 year old single male, who has been in this apartment for the past year, and I love the area. It's quiet, pretty, and incredibly convenient. Parking is easy to be found, and just right across the street is a Rite Aid, Starbucks, Kings, and Sparrow Liquor Store. Another block down, brings you to the river and Pier 13!<br><br>\nI work in Jersey City as an Architectural Engineer, and am out of the apartment from 7:30 am to anywhere from 6-8 pm. I usually go to the gym when I get home, and then settle in with a beer or a bowl, and watch a little netflix before I head to bed. On weekends, I try to do something outside - hop into the city for the day, go for a run or a bike ride, etc. It would be very cool if I had a roommate who had a similar schedule and in addition to being someone to live with, was also someone to hang out with.<br><br>\nApartment layout includes a galley kitchen (no dishwasher), but clean and functional appliances. A living room that has been furnished by me, the bathroom in the back, and the two bedrooms. My bedroom is the smaller one, and yours will be the larger one, shown in the pictures. Rent is split evenly regardless of bedroom sizing, gas and water are included in our rent payments, and electric and internet are extra. Laundry is in the building! Just take the elevator down to the basement where there are readily available washers and dryers. Wash is $1.50 per wash, and drying is .25 cents/ten minutes. The room will come with an electronic laundry card for you to be able to get your undies clean.<br><br>\n-Rent is $2400/month total, split into $1200/month/person. The building is owned by Applied Housing, so automatic E-Payments are set up and super convenient. There are no broker fees or anything like that, just an administrative fee of $150 to add your name to all the rent paperwork when you move in.<br>\n-Electric is with PSEG, and the bill varies by season - it runs more expensive in the summertime due to the air conditioning.<br>\n-Internet is currently with Optimum, with 100 mbps down/30 up. No cable at the moment, since neither of us ever watched much live tv. I'm happy to upgrade to faster internet, switch to Fios, or add cable, depending on what your preferences are.<br>\n-Pets! I love pets, especially dogs! However, I currently don't have one here with me. For reference, animals are allowed in the building for an additional fee to the rent. Should you be bringing a furry companion, they will be more than welcome, however the monthly fee for the pet will be your financial responsibility.<br><br>\nI'm available to meet and show the apartment anytime after 7 PM during the week, and anytime during the weekends. If you like what you've read so far, and think you're a good fit, please shoot me an email and tell me a little bit about yourself! Anyone and everyone is welcome to apply! If all goes well, we can set times to view the apartment and have a beer or two!<br><br>\nPS - Apologies for the cluttered room pictures - current roommate is in the middle of packing up all his things, and I wanted to show what you'd be getting in terms of size and layout.    </section>"

The apartment is located 1 block away from the Myrtle/Wycoff L and M subway station and within walking distance to grocery stores, bars, parks etc. The images of the bedroom are actually not the one you are renting but it's very similar - just a little smaller.<br><br>\nThe monthly rent is $1,125 and I'd like to have both months paid upfront - so $2,250 to move in. The lease ends July 31st and if you'd like to stay you'll have first dibs on signing a new lease. Gas, electric and internet run at about $125 per month.<br><br>\nI'm a female in my late twenties, really tidy and pretty chill. I work in magazine publishing and like to be in bed by 11pm on weeknights. I also have a lovely chihuahua named Taco who spends 75% of the day napping. <br><br>\nShowing the room in the evenings and on weekends. <br><br>\nIf interested please send along a little about yourself and link to social media accounts.    </section>"

Walkability is everything! Close to the Rail Trail, Water St Market, great restaurants, campus and everything New Paltz has to offer.<br><br>\nYou enter into a very large fenced in yard and onto the screened in front porch to enter this lovely apt. It is all about open space here. Full kitchen oversees dining area and living space. Kitchen has lots of cabinets, w/dryer, and window over looking a garden arbor. Room aplenty for that farm table and couch and extra seating in front of the picture window. Peer out at the fenced in yard here and another large garden arbor. The kitchen is tiled, but wide plank flooring is throughout most of the house. Great view of the gorgeous fireplace from every angle. Combined space is 15x30.-<br><br>\nUpstairs the 3 bedrooms share 1 bath. Bath is 8x6, has tiled floor and shower. Carpeted bedroom has 4 windows, is 11x17 and 2 great closets.

Third bedroom we use as an office, its 10x14, a double window, big closet here, too.<br><br>\nThis apt will be rented unfurnished.  <br><br>\nEach bedroom is rented separately, and SINGLE OCCUPANCY in each of the 3 bedrooms.

We keep an active presence on the property, maintaining it and keeping it a safe place to live.  This apt has tenants downstairs, so quiet and respectful is key to a peaceful environment. Obviously, this is not a party house, nor are undergraduates accepted.  <br><br>\nIf interested in setting up an appointment, please share as much information about yourself and come prepared w/good landlord and verifiable income information. No third party checks accepted.  If no local and/or recent references, you will need to pay last month's rent also. We require one month security and a year's lease obligation.

A Blue Bottle Coffee is literally next door, and Swallow, Cup &amp; City of Saints are all close by for more coffee options; we are also a short walk from Roberta's Pizza, Momo Sushi Shack, Falansai, El Cortez, Bunna Ethiopian, Champs Diner and more. Bars include Alaska, Pine Box (Vegan) Rock Shop, Duck Duck, etc. Local retail highlights include Friends, Beacons Closet and the new Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown.

The room is on the first floor, facing the backyard. 8.5x12.5' with a private bathroom. Closet space. You aren't sharing walls with another bedroom at all, the other two are upstairs so it's pretty private. :)<br><br>\nAvailable June 1 for the year. We would like someone who can get on the lease, but are willing to chat about a sublet as well. <br><br>\nMost people who come over categorize it as cute and homey.  It has almost a beach house vibe to it. The ceilings are on the lower side so if you are 6' or above you may not love it here.<br><br>\nRoommates both in their 30s: Stephen is full time illustrator. Anita is a freelance art director. We have active lifestyles and are often not around in the evenings but do like to hang out as well, totally friendly vibes over here. It's a pretty good balance. We would be happy to share more info regarding ourselves. There is a common area upstairs as well that the other two bedrooms split for desk space so there's a lot of space for people not to be on top of each other. We don't often have people over and if we do it's pretty mellow---not a party house is what I'm getting at. (Once in a while we do host a party but this will be cleared ahead of time, you'll never come home to find people raging out in the apartment when all you want is to go to bed.)<br><br>\nThe downstairs is kept clean and tidy. Once in a blue there may be a dish in the sink (it really bothers me so this absolutely not a day to day thing) or we don't sweep a hair too long. So ideally you are someone who is on the clean and tidy side but won't freak out about an occasional messier day. We don't assign chores, it's worked out with everyone cleaning up after themselves and taking turns mopping or doing a bigger clean up as needed. It works out well. <br><br>\n1333 plus utilities (usually around 60/mo). Security deposit required prior to move date.<br><br>\nContact for any additional info or to come see the space. :)<br><br>\nNo pets, sorry. <br><br>\nSorry about the terrible photos!    </section>"

It is located in Hamilton heights off of 153rd street close to the ABCD trains. The 1 train is about a 10 minute walk away as well. There is a bunch of bars and restaurants in the area as well, all about a 10 minute walk away such as Harlem Public, The Grange, the Chipped Cup, and The Honeywell. <br><br>\nThe apartment is on the second floor so moving everything up the stairs is a breeze. We have a a nice size kitchen, living space, and entry way. All the common areas are furnished but if you have some stuff you want to bring with you there is space for more. We have a banging ass couch, fully dressed bar, side tables and chairs. A dining room table is on the way so dinner parties will become a thing. There is a laundry room in the basement in the building as well!<br><br>\nYour room is large with a nice window and closet. It comfortably fits a queen size bed, dresser, bookshelf, and beside table. Pictures will be posted soon! <br><br>\nOk. Enough with the boring info. <br><br>\nRoommate 1 is a bad ass to pastry chef of a catering company. She is the mother of the best dog in the entire world and a very average cat.  She works mornings and spends her free time chilling at home, drinking on rooftops, and cuddling with her pets. <br><br>\nRoommate 2 is a pastry chef of a restaurant in midtown. He works 14 hours a day and is barely home. When he isnt at work he is making cocktails at home, drinking in the park, or planning his next trip to South America. <br><br>\nWe are both friendly and outgoing people and like an easy going environment at home. <br><br>\nOnly inquire if you are lgbt friendly, pet friendly, and generally a pleasant person. We are looking for someone who is in there 20s or 30s, has a stable job, and is clean and respectful. Send us an email with some information about yourself. The room is available May 1 but feel free to move in anytime. The room is a one year lease!!    </section>"

I'm in my late 20s and currently work as an Operations Manager in a start-up company. I'm sociable and love getting to know people, but generally like things to quit down in the apartment by 11PM. I work long hours, so usually when I'm home, I'm resting or watching TV in my room.<br><br>\nAbout the apartment: <br><br>\nThe apartment is a true two bedroom, with lots of light and amenities. It is fully furnished with a sizable living room, separate kitchen, and renovated bathroom. The bedroom that you would be living in has 2 windows, walk-in closet, dresser and a window AC unit that can be reattached. The room costs $1200 + utilities, which is generally $50-60 per a month. This is ideal for anyone looking for a clean, safe place to stay.<br><br>\nAbout the neighborhood: <br><br>\nThe building is located a 3-4 minute walk from the 30th Ave. N/W subway and a 10 minute walk from the M/R station at Steinway. The neighborhood is safe and lively, with tons of bars and restaurants just steps away from the apartment.<br><br>\nAbout you:<br><br>\nIdeally, you would be a responsible (cannot stress this enough), quiet person who is sociable but doesn't throw parties. <br><br>\nMove in date is flexible (prefer to find someone by beginning of June) . Security deposit ($1200) + 1 month rent is required in order to move in.<br><br>\nFeel free to email me if you are interested or have any questions about the place.<br></section>"

Hers a photo of the mattress. Its around the same price as a hostel bunk bed yet you have your own room, closet, super thick queen sized air mattress, etc. 70 bucks if over a week 85 bucks a night if less. 20 Ave C. The apt is on the ground floor facing the street. The windows are frosted high enough that people cant see in. <br><br>\n1st photo is of the air mattress ( or perhaps an even better one) <br>\n2nd photo is of size of kitchen<br>\n3rd photo is size of \\bathroom<br>\n4th photo is size of studio minus the lofted bed. <br><br>\nIt's a new building built from the ground up so unlike Stuyvesant town the walls are thick and you can't hear your neighbors below or above you. The building has a fast elevator and laundry on every floors. Also the building is very pet friendly.<br><br>\nBasically the apartment has no issues. All the bedrooms are a nice size. It's not on ave D, it's not above a bar, it's not near a hospital or on a strange block. It's actually on a well lit, active residential tree-lined street. The area is phenomenal- situated in the East Village and within walking distance to Gramercy Park, Lower East Side, Soho, NYU. H, RF, V, J, M,Z train are minutes away. 6 train is 8 minutes away. There is a WHOLE FOODS and a 1 year old YMCA with an Olympic sized swimming pool 5 minutes away. <br><br>\nPlease email me your basics like how long you need the room for, the best number to reach you etc. <br><br>\nThanks, Nicholas    </section>"

The room  has two big windows that face a courtyard and comes with a full bed, small dresser, shelf unit, lamp, and closet.

The room is available from May 1 through August 31.<br><br>\nThe apartment is spacious with an eat-in kitchen and a separate living and dining room, and the bathroom is, er, kind of hilarious - it inexplicably has 2 showers. But otherwise it's a perfectly great bathroom :) All utilities and a cleaner are included. I'm looking for a respectful professional who can happily share and maintain the space.<br><br>\nThere is laundry in the building, a large supermarket 3 short blocks away, and all needed amenities within a 10-minute walk. The local and express trains are 5-10 minutes away, and you can be in Manhattan in about 30 minutes from the front door.<br><br>\nThe apartment would be shared with me, early thirties professional female. I work in the city and love to be able to come home and chill, so I am looking for someone easy going. I am open to socializing and having guests, though I like to keep the apartment a relatively relaxed place.<br><br>\nRequires signed sublease agreement and first month's rent plus two weeks security deposit. Please put your favorite dinosaur in the subject line so I know you've read this whole post.    </section>"

Room has a bed with a nice mattress already. AC unit the regular stuff.<br>\nFirst floor apt with two chill roommates.<br>\nOne female works as a freelancer in commercial production and dabbles in a few industries, and one male student who works in the music business. Female is significantly older than the male. Sad to see the other roommate go.<br>\nAlso I (female) have an old and darling hypoallergenic cat named Chuck. So, not additional pets.<br>\nStandard size NYC bedroom + closet.<br>\nWe do have a backyard as well :)<br><br>\nThis part of Bushwick is blowing up so fast but with a great sense of community! See link of drone video below showing the walk from the train to one of the buildings in the neighborhood. There is a lovely restaurant and bar across the street, a great bodega, and a great laundry mat all in the four corners of our block. One block away from the L train and a 5 minute walk to the J train.<br>\nSo many other gifts including a park all in the very near vicinity. Lots of street parking too if you have a car.<br>\nALSO, we are in Bushwick but are such a short walk to Ridgewood, which is lovely. Great stores, markets, etc in less than a 10 minutes walk.<br><br>\nLooking for someone to solidify their commitment to the apartment ASAP but move in May 1st. (could be earlier if needed)<br><br>\nThree way split on the rent $1000 + utilities (averaging $100 a month).<br>\nTo move in you should be charming, woke, polite, be able to pay the rent, and not want to bring the party home unless it is in your bedroom. ;)<br>\nNeeded to move in: First + Last + Deposit $3000.<br><br>\nThe pictures I have put are not the best ones, I will try and update later today!<br>\n(we have a nicer couch now, etc)<br>\nCall! This apt usually doesnt last when I post looking for roomies :)<br><br>\nHere is the link to the drone video focusing on our little corner of Bushwick.<br>\nhttp://gothamist.com/2016/08/03/subway_drone_bushwick.php<br><br><br>\nThank you and good luck to you!<br><br>\nxo, L    </section>"

It has a large closet and recently renovated. One shared bathroom, open concept living, dining and kitchen area. This is a second floor walk up in a private house. Room is not furnished.<br><br>\nAbout the neighborhood:<br>\nThere is a laundromat and supermarket a few blocks away and 2 deli's right around the corner from the apartment. We are centrally located between the G, J, M and Z trains on the Flushing Avenue stops. <br><br>\nAbout us:<br>\nWe are 2 males in our early 30's with a 4 year old dog. Both work in the service industry. We like to cook and binge watch on Netflix when possible. <br><br>\nAbout you:<br>\nWe are seeking a male roommate who is not allergic to dogs. Have a supporting job to cover your rent. Be mindful and respectable to one another. Maintain the common area clean after use (this includes the living, dining, kitchen and bathroom). Chip in with house chores to keep the apartment clean. Parties are not allowed, but social gatherings are okay as per the landlord. And lastly, be able to socialize with each other to make a home feeling instead of a hotel feeling. <br><br>\nRequirements:<br>\nWe would sign a 1 year lease with the possibility to an extension. It will be one month's rent and deposit. Utilities will consist of Wifi and Electricity and monthly statements are disclosed and split evenly.  <br><br><br>\nIf this seems like a fit for you, feel free to send me an email. <br><br>\nBest,<br>\nOmar<br></section>"

The apartment is located 1 block away from the Myrtle/Wycoff L and M subway station and within walking distance to grocery stores, bars, parks etc. The images of the bedroom are actually not the one you are renting but it's very similar - just a little smaller.<br><br>\nThe monthly rent is $1,125 and I'd like to have both months paid upfront - so $2,250 to move in. The lease ends July 31st and if you'd like to stay you'll have first dibs on signing a new lease. Gas, electric and internet run at about $125 per month.<br><br>\nI'm a female in my late twenties, really tidy and pretty chill. I work in magazine publishing and like to be in bed by 11pm on weeknights. I also have a lovely chihuahua named Taco who spends 75% of the day napping. <br><br>\nShowing the room in the evenings and on weekends. <br><br>\nIf interested please send along a little about yourself and link to social media accounts.<br><br><br><br></section>"

It's in a large, funky apt in a very quiet nonsmoking house.  There are cats in the apt, so you should be either cat-friendly or at least cat-tolerant.  Some are fostered, while some will be staying.  The roommate would be there very little, as she has another apt in the same house.<br><br>\nThe room includes a full sized bed, desk, dresser with mirror and armoire closet.  There is other closet space outside the room which you can have beyond the armoire, if needed.  There is a large kitchen, which is slated for renovation in the coming months.<br>\nThe full bathroom is at the other end of the apt, but you would be the only one showering there.<br><br>\nThe house is in the midst of the St. George historic land marked district, which is quiet, safe, artsy and up-and-coming.  There are great restaurants around (Beso, Blue, Pier 76, Enoteca, Salad Junkie, Thai, to name a few), art fairs, and two farmers markets in walking distance.  <br><br>\nYou can walk to the ferry in ten minutes-- it's always free and runs 24/7 to lower Manhattan!  You can also connect there with all buses and the Island train.  Commuters and visitors are welcome!  <br><br>\nThe backyard is huge, and gardeners are welcome, too.  <br><br>\nSeeking a responsible nonsmoking tenant who has a great rent paying history, stable employment and/or school, and decent credit. There is a month to month written agreement.  The rent includes all utilities and wifi.    </section>"

There will also be the option to resign on the lease for another year. <br><br>\nYou- My roommates are looking for a mid to late twenty something year old professional female to move in on 6/1 and staying until the lease is up on 9/30. You are friendly, responsible, tidy and respectful to the apartment common spaces. <br><br>\nThe roommates- My current roommates are awesome! Very friendly and respectful while in the apartment. Both roommates are employed full time with Monday to Friday jobs in the Accounting and Media industries. Both live very active and busy lives outside the apartment. Apartment vibe is very chill/relaxed on weeknights and quiet by 10pm. They do not bring the party home and except the new roommate to do the same. <br><br>\nThe apartment- huge 1bd/1ba that has been permanently flexed into a three bedroom with FULL walls/doors. Roomates share the living room, kitchen (w/ dishwasher!) and bathroom. Huge closet in living space is split between the two flex rooms. Unit is on a high floor of a very nice full service high-rise in the financial district. (AC, elevators, 24 hr doorman, gym, laundry in building and one of the best roof tops in the area) Close to many subway lines at Fulton Street. Cleaning responsibilities are shared and apartment costs (wifi, electric, household goods) are split evenly by 3. <br><br>\nThe room- Room has huge windows and full flex walls/doors for privacy. Very pretty views of the World Trade Center. Photos currently show a queen-size bed and dresser. Large closet in common room is shared with one other roommate. <br><br>\nHouse keeping/additional information:<br>\n- 1 month rent + security deposit required ($1250 security to secure + $1250 due prior to move in) Electric in the summer months is approx $60pp due to AC. <br>\n- Seublease will run from 6/1 to 9/30 with option to resign a new lease with current roomates starting in October. <br>\n- Must have employment and be able to show income for approx 40x your portion of the rent. Sorry but no consigners. There is an online application (with fee) and approval process that must be followed. Management is strict on their requirements. <br>\n- You will be added to the unit as an occupant and will be considered an official resident of the building. I will also remain on the lease until the end. <br>\n- As a side note, I will be selling a bunch of furniture cheap, if interested. (Queen bedframe/mattress, dresser, desk/chair etc) <br><br><br>\nWe are looking to fill the room asap but really value the fit of the new roommate so serious inquiries only! Open house style viewing to see the space and meet the roomates this Wednesday at 730 pm. If you are interested please respond to the posting with a little bit of background about yourself (profession, hobbies, lifestyle etc) and feel free to ask additional questions.    </section>"

Great way to get off the summer lease cycle!<br><br>\nThe apartment is located on the Upper East Side, on 78th/York. The apartment is located one block from the M79 bus, and a ten minute walk to the 6 or the Q! Perfect location, especially for those in the medical profession, as it is a short walk to all the major UES hospitals. Also near all sorts of bars, restaurants, etc. and close to Central Park.<br><br>\nMy current roommate will be staying. She is 23 years old and works at Sloan Cancer Center. She isn't home often, and is very friendly and easy to live with.<br><br>\nThe common space in the apartment comes furnished (all I will be taking with me is the television). Kitchen includes a dishwasher. Bedroom will come unfurnished, and includes a closet. There is lots of natural light in the apartment, and it has been very well-maintained.<br><br>\nRent is $1250, and includes utilities. Laundry is in building, and it is part of the only gated community on the UES. This is a beautiful building, next to a park and the East River. There is a package room, and handymen on site. There is also security at night. Overall, this is a very safe neighborhood and I have never felt unsafe walking around, no matter the time of day/night.<br><br>\nThe building requires a credit check, so in addition to the $1250 rent they would require $80 for a credit check and $200 for the application fee.<br><br>\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, or know someone who would be interested! Happy to send more photos (these were taken prior to when we moved in) or to show the place.    </section>"

Beautiful, pre-war building on historic Riverside Drive, a minute from Riverside park (great for jogging, dog-walking, cook-outs), 1-train subway (30 minutes to mid-town), Fairway supermarket and numerous other attractions (many great bars and restaurants, Columbia U., Manhattan School of Music). <br><br>\nRe: roommates. Since my other two roommates will be moving out at the end of the month, there's a decent chance you will have this massive 3 br apartment entirely to yourself for the summer.

I have a wonderful furnished bedroom for sublet starting May 15th until July 31! If you need a little time in August, that's also negotiable. It is a renovated 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath apartment in the heart of Bushwick. It is a few short blocks from the L train (Wilson or Halsey) and a few blocks from the J(Halsey). It is also close to several bus stops, 24 hour bodegas, and right across the street from a nice park. Laundry room is downstairs in the basement and there is also rooftop access for a a great view. Female preferred! <br><br>\nAbout the room/apartment: the room comes fully furnished with a full size bed, desk, under the bed drawers, and a full size closet. It is a pretty decent size room and it is conveniently located right across from both bathrooms. The room only shares one wall with another room and an individual A/C and heat unit. The apartment has video intercom, high ceilings, and stainless steel appliances. The kitchen has everything and feel free to use all the kitchen has to offer such as bowls, cooking pans, utensils, cups, etc.<br><br>\nAbout the roommates: We are all in our mid-to-late 20's and are all currently going to grad school at NYU! Both roommates are clean and super laid back, quiet, and friendly. They are wanting someone who is similar. <br><br>\nPrice: Rent is $950 and that includes ALL utilities as well. What you'll need to pay: Half of May's rent ($475) First months rent (950) + deposit (500) = $1925 total. Please send me an email with some information about yourself (occupation, age, etc) and what you're looking for. I can also send more pictures of the room/apartment. I'm hoping to find the right fit asap!    </section>"

If you need longer, we can offer this room up until the middle of June. <br><br>\nThe room is somewhat furnished and ready to move in. The bedroom has floor to ceiling walls and a door with key so it is 100% private. We share the apartment with three other guys in their 20s, who have a professional working life, so everyone is highly responsible and noise levels are always low. I want to also stress this location is absolutely amazing, with ALL subway stops either on the same block as the building, or one or two streets away. This location is also on the same block as the Empire State Building, and our rooftop has great views and you will also have access to the gym/lounge on the top floor. Laundry, elevators, 24hr doormen in the building. There is tons of nightlife and food places around too. Literally everything you need is closely accessible!<br><br>\nAbout the roommates:<br><br>\nSo yeah, we're 3 dudes so it will get a little messy every now and then, but we get maid service once a month. Comes out to about $20ish. Bathroom situation is good too. I have to leave by 8:30am, Adam has to leave by 9:00-10ish, and Peter is usually not home. Either way, we don't really take too long in the bathroom. <br><br>\nAdam -- Half Asian, Software Engineer at a real estate analytics company, is chill. Most ladies would rate him as a 3/10 at best though, but is a great wingman. Nickname is Captain America. Has a tendency to walk around shirtless<br><br>\nPeter -- Asian, Consultant, travels pretty much every week so isn't home much, is chill.<br><br>\nDavid -- Asian, Product Manager at a health tech company, aspires to be a Youtube star, travels not as much as peter (but still often), is chill. <br><br>\nYou -- Is chill, doesn't really cook much, doesn't care it's 2 1/2 asian guys, is chill<br><br>\nIf you are interested in this room, please reach out to us with a little about yourself and when the earliest you can move in is. Also please provide linkedin and/or facebook as well. <br><br>\nThanks!    </section>"

I travel back and forth to see my family in Florida so there are many days that I will not<br>\nbe home for a week or more (so you can have the whole place to yourself:)<br>\nI usually keep to myself and keep my door closed.  <br>\nI usually go out to see friends and might have the occasional friend come over during the weekend. <br>\nOriginally born in Latvia (near Finland) but have lived in NY since I was 5 years old. <br>\nI come from a great family (they all live in Florida). <br>\nI am very friendly:) <br><br>\n------<br><br>\nThe water pressure is very good and there is always hot water in the shower.<br>\nAll basic appliances in the kitchen work perfectly (Refrigerator/Stove/Oven/Microwave). <br>\nYou can paint the room and nail anything you want to the walls.<br>\nThe room is completely unfurnished, so you can put any furniture you want.<br>\nThere are NO NEIGHBORS directly attached to the apartment, so you can tap dance or blast music in your room (if im not home haha). <br>\nThe room has a nicely sized closet to fit all your things. <br><br>\nNo dogs or cats (I am allergic very sorry). <br>\nNo smoking (you can smoke out of your window or go downstairs thats fine).<br>\nThere are NO BUGS!!

Guy or girl.  <br>\nThe rent is $770 a month + half of the utilities/internet. <br>\nFirst months deposit right away.<br>\nLooking for minimum of 1 year stay. <br><br>\nThanks!<br>\nLet me know if you want to schedule a day to come see it or if you have any other questions. <br>\nMove in days are either April 15th or May 1st. <br><br>\n- Roman (Artsy European Guy) <br><br></section>"

I absolutely adore this apartment and my roommates, and would love to see someone awesome fill the spot! While I am ideally looking to cover all of June and July, I also have a lot of flexibility with move-in and move-out dates.<br><br>\nThe apartment is located at 10th and 54th street in Hells Kitchen. There are 3 bedrooms (the master with its own bathroom, my room, and the flex), as well as a large living room, w/d in unit, large kitchen, and dishwasher. The building is quiet, but still in an awesome neighborhood (tons of pubs and restaurants). My room overlooks an interior courtyard, so its virtually silent at night. I also use the room as my office, so there is a desk, chair, and couch chair.<br><br>\nAbout my roommates - 2 girls, 25 and 28, working in law and marketing. They are both super sweet and responsible, and will want to meet you before moving in (or at least via Skype). Women are preferred, as there is a shared bathroom with one of the roommates.<br><br>\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions!<br></section>"

The room is available as of May 1 in our shared apartment.  Please read the whole ad and reply with the minimum requested information if you'd like to be invited to an interview!<br><br>\nThe monthly rent is ($ 750) monthly utilities are ($ 50)and these expenses are consolidated in one monthly 800$ payment. <br>\nThe 50 dollar Utility fee includes high speed internet, gas, electric, and a split of shared house cleaning supplies, TP, etc. <br>\nProrated days in May for move in after the first at a rate of $25.81/day. Minimum lease period two months. <br>\n1 st month (800) + Security Deposit (800) to move in = $1600  for lease starting May 1. <br><br>\nRoom:<br>\n-Small, Private, Lofted Bedroom<br>\n-5' x 6 1/2' loft, <br>\n-11' ceiling<br>\n-2'x6' window facing NE <br>\n-One Electrical Outlet<br>\n-Fixed rod to hang clothes, <br>\n-Furnished with a futon mattress in the loft and small desk and bookshelf.<br><br>\nThe solid loft frame occupies most of the floor space of the room. <br>\nBottom deck of loft is 6 1/2' and bisects the window for good natural light and airflow above and below, 3' up top to ceiling. Most people can walk around underneath without stooping. Storage space in the rest of the house is very limited, so it would be best for a person who isn't moving with a lot of furniture.<br><br>\nApartment:<br>\nTop floor of a historic building 2 blocks from the Kingston - Throop C, and 4-5 blocks from the A express at Nostrand Ave. Laundry, groceries, etc. on Fulton Ave. close by. The building is an old walk up with no elevator. <br><br>\nSemi-renovated in mid-2009 with appliances from that time. The whole apartment has 11' ceilings with original moldings, radiator heat, refinished wood or newly tiled floors with excellent sunlight and airflow throughout. Living room is a very large and open space (12' x 17') with built in bookshelves and two big windows. <br><br>\nHouse Culture:<br>\nWe have more of a well maintained quiet, retreat and life-project space than a collective, a restful and peaceful place to de-stress from city life. Independent, responsible people that value privacy and order tend to love it here. We are friendly, but mostly cultivate our social lives outside the home and are looking for another who is the same. We usually don't host social gatherings beyond dinner with a friend once in awhile.<br><br>\nThere are a few agreements we have come to as a house and we have systems in place so that there is rarely any interpersonal conflict, it is always really clean, rent and utilities are paid on time every month, and we never run out of TP or cleaning supplies. <br><br>\nEach of us cleans a designated part of the house weekly and we also always neaten up after our kitchen and bathroom use, so no one ever has to do their housemate's dishes or deal with anyone else's hair in the shower, and we have never had roaches. <br>\nWe usually observe quiet hours in the living room and kitchen starting at 10 in the evening weekdays to accommodate those of us who have early schedules. <br><br>\nWe each limit our overnight guests to 3x week and negotiate shower timing amongst ourselves. As a courtesy to the other housemates, we send a group texts to announce our guests and discuss in advance plans for the common space that would impact everyone else's use and enjoyment of the apartment. <br><br>\nFlatmates:<br>\nThere are four other housemates. about half of us ID as queer, trans, etc. and we're all between the ages of 28 and 42. We sometimes have friends over for casual dinner and low-key hang outs but no hard partying happens here. Diets range from vegetarian - omnivorous. We don't usually get together as a group but see each other in passing + mostly keep in touch via text and email for the day-to-day stuff. Such is NY. <br><br>\nCurrent housemates are:<br>\nWCM (LA native, food industry, comedy writer)<br>\nQWTM (Legal worker, clicktivist from Detroit)/ <br>\nQWCM (NY native, activist, IT person, launching a tech startup ) / <br>\nWCF (Art Therapy student, Barista, from DC)/<br>\n( C means cisgender, and T means transgender )<br><br>\nYou should be:<br>\n- one adult person<br>\n- able to live in a small lofted space<br>\n- able to communicate clearly and dependably<br>\n- financially stable <br>\n- 9-5'er or student<br>\n- a non-smoker<br>\n- not a pet owner <br>\n- super clean/ receptive to feedback on maintaining house standards<br>\n- quiet and respectful of common spaces<br>\n- POC or antiracist if you are white and queer/trans friendly if you're str8/cis<br>\n- considerate and mature <br>\n- conscious and bringing life experience<br>\n- preference for people staying for a specific term, although this is a month to month sublease, (please read the note below on the notice requirements for a month to month sublease in NYC!)<br><br>\nUltimately, we're looking for a roommate that is meticulously clean, wants the same home life as we are cultivating, communicates well, and understands what shared responsibility and space is about. We consider ourselves to be responsible, considerate, mature and want one more roommate that is the same. <br><br>\nIf interested, please respond with relevant information about yourself, such as why you are moving, what you are looking for in housing, why this ad appealed to you, your contact information (email and cel), and your availability to meet and see the space nights and weekends. <br><br>\nApt 8 'mates<br><br>\n++ 'Month to Month' means the lease is terminable by either party with at least 30 days notice before the 1st of the month preceding a vacancy. <br>\n++ 'Security Deposit' means that the tenant's security (800$) will be held in escrow and returned upon move out given reasonable wear and tear, in other words the subtenant is responsible for providing adequate notice of their intention to move out and for leaving the premises in good repair (reasonable wear and tear) at that time. The lessor is responsible for reimbursing the security upon full payment of rent, adequate notice of vacancy, and timely vacancy with reasonable wear and tear.    </section>"

We're looking for a clean, employed roommate for our three bedroom apartment. <br><br>\nThe pictures don't do it justice - lots of nice natural light, a big window, and a fireplace opening from when it was built in the 1920s. The apartment has GE stainless steel appliances including a dishwasher, 10' ceilings, hardwood floors, and a couple of really chill roommates who you'll live with. This room was really good to me for a long time, and friends before that. There is:<br><br>\nlaundry in the building<br>\na beautiful park down the street, and YMCA on the other side.<br>\na view and fire escape looking out onto a quiet, very safe street that also houses many young urbanites<br>\nnice neighbors in the building<br>\na helpful repairman<br>\nOne year old IKEA dresser with double mirrors and new IKEA full bed with drawers that pull out. Very useful!<br>\nSend-it-away laundry service across the street<br>\nDeli on the corner, as well as an IHOP, oh man.<br>\nAccess to FOUR subway lines - each a block away - 2/3 line and the B/C. It takes about 25 minutes to get to midtown.<br><br>\nAlso--street parking RIGHT in front of the building!<br><br>\nI'm leaving to live with my fiance - otherwise I'd still be there. Please ask any questions and send us your:<br><br>\nname<br>\navailability to come see the apt<br>\nlikes, dislikes?<br>\nschedule, job, interests<br><br>\nEmail for photos!

Short walk to the LIC waterfront to get the best view on the Manhattan skyline.<br><br>\nRent is $1000 plus utilities (usually around $70)<br><br>\nThe room is roughly 10x9 ft with good sunlight (1 window) - lot of character.

The other room I would like to share is about 120 sq ft. There is a full size bed, a wardrobe, a large Ikea shelf unit, two desks and two chairs inside the bedroom.    Besides, the living room and the open kitchen are large. <br><br>\nThe apartment is at a 2nd floor house, 3 minutes walk to D train 79th street station. It's about half an hour to Brooklyn downtown, 40 minutes to Manhattan downtown. It takes about 20 minutes to Coney Island in the opposite direction.  <br><br>\nThere are many grocery stores and restaurants in this neighbourhood.

Apartment is the second floor of a three-floor house on a street about a five minute walk from Ferry. Three minute drive/20 minute walk to Newark Penn for easy NYC commuting. Close to Rutgers Newark, NJIT, and Seton Hall Law. Also close to two parks and many great restaurants. <br><br>\nApartment features living room, dining area, and an excellent kitchen. Three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms. Three closets in shared areas, in addition to the closet in your room. Private washer/dryer in the basement. Hardwood floors, security system, and balcony. Shared areas are furnished (sofas, tables, TV, kitchen table, etc) and kitchen has the usual (microwave, fridge, dishwasher) plus plenty of gadgets. Two off-street parking spots to be shared by the three of us; plenty of street parking for the third person.<br><br>\nAbout me: I am a female math teacher and part-time grad student in my late twenties. I'm tidy, quiet, and a non-smoker. I am looking for roommates of a similar personality and roughly similar age. NO SMOKING. Each bedroom is for one person. If you and a friend are interested in renting both bedrooms, that's fine; if you are interested in renting only one bedroom for yourself, that's fine too. Move in would be around the end of June (exact date negotiable).<br><br>\nI am currently ONLY looking for roommates who would be interested in signing a year-long (July '17- June '18) lease. Planning to stay longer would be even better but I'm not interested in short-term subleters. <br><br>\nI have lived here for five years and feel very safe here. It's a lovely apartment with a homey feel. Please reach out with any questions that you have. I look forward to talking with you!    </section>"

The room can easily fit a double or queen, although a double would probably be best suited for the space. The closet for this room is our walk-in coat closet, which is right across from one of the bedrooms and next to the bathroom door. You will be sharing a bathroom with one of the girls, there is a second bathroom with a shower in the master bedroom. Pictures are attached of the apartment, room and closet. <br><br>\nRent is $1235. Move-in fees will include a security deposit - $167, amenity fee - $350, and fee for leasing the fake wall - $50 Monthly bills usually end up netting out to be:<br><br>\n$44.00 per month for TV<br>\n$30-40 per month for electric/gas<br>\n*Sometimes it has been as low as $13, and as high as $50<br>\n$20 per month for water<br><br>\n77 Park is an elevator building and has great amenities, including a doorman, on-site gym, laundry room, 3rd floor sun deck with grills, and in-house dry cleaning services. The building in a great location - close to downtown (can be at a nail salon, small market, and a bar within 4-5 minutes of walking) and a 5-7 minute walk to the PATH train. The building has garage parking available underneath the building for a fee of ~$275/month. <br><br>\nLooking for someone that is respectful, relatively low-key, and organized. My roommate and I do go out quite often, but don't normally host parties or pre-games in our apartment and would expect the same of our roommate. I am a dietitian working in NYC; usually out the door at 7 am and return home by 6pm.  I sometimes work weekends. My roommate works as an accountant and is usually out the door at around 9am and returns home after 7:30/8pm.<br></section>"

The apartment is two blocks away from the Carl Schulz Park and one block from East River Esplanade (great for walking/jogging). The rent is $1,140/month and utilities run approximately $70/month which includes wireless internet and electricity. You'd sign a lease though, so there'd be no surprises.<br><br>\nThis is a cozy two bedroom, one bath apartment. Your bedroom can easily fit a full-size bed and a dresser, and has two brand new windows - literally installed a few months ago. There is an elevator and laundry machine ($1.50 in quarters for each the washer/dryer) in the building. The apartment is on the 6th floor. The Super is SUPER responsive and lives in the building! :^) <br><br>\nTransportation: really close to the M31, M86, M79 Buses. It's about an 8 minute walk to the new 2nd Avenue Subway stop on 83/2 and a 15 minute walk to the 4/5/6 stop on 86/Lexington.<br><br>\nAbout me: I'm super busy - I work relatively long hours and will be studying for the GRE. I cook most nights, so I do use the kitchen - fully functional stove, refrigerator, etc. I'm really easy to get along with, I'm funny, I like basketball, Seinfeld, and Viceland. I am relatively clean and I'd expect you to clean up after yourself in the living room, kitchen, and bathroom.<br><br>\nAbout you: Male/Female, 21-31, stable job with proof of income. You need to contribute to buying shared things like toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc - if you see that something's running low, you should be cool with buying it for us (if I already haven't). Unfortunately no pets (I wish we could)! A big plus if you can bring some furniture for the common areas - a kitchen table and chairs, TV, etc will be needed after my roommate moves out.<br><br>\nA security deposit ($1850) is required upon move-in.<br><br>\nShoot me an email if the above sounds good to you! I don't want this to be a lengthy process, so if I like you, then you're good!<br></section>"

My roommate is moving out and I am looking for a roommate to take his place on the lease. The room will be available on June 1st.<br><br>\nABOUT THE BUILDING:<br>\nThe building is professionally maintained. The management takes great care of the place and handle any issues very quickly. They also own the store beneath the complex and are always available to assist. The place is exterminated for pests once and month and I have never see one in the apartment other than the occasional fly. There are four apartments per floor, so it is very quiet and intimate. The building also has an elevator and laundry facilities on site so you can say goodbye to lugging your dirty clothes to the laundromat, and having to carry them up five flights of stairs!!! On the commuting end, we are equidistant to the PATH station and the light rail (about 10-15 minutes walking) and the bus to NYC is a block away. <br><br>\nABOUT THE APARTMENT:<br>\nThe apartment is a two-bedroom, two bathroom and is located on the top floor of the building. There is a large living area which has a private balcony facing east and is attached to the kitchen with a breakfast bar. The kitchen is equipped with stainless steel appliances including a dishwasher. There is hardwood flooring throughout the apartment with the exception of the bathrooms, which are tiled. The apartment is warmed and cooled by built-in wall units. <br><br>\nThe room that is available is a good size and can easily fit a queen bed, dressers, desk, etc. There is great closet space in both the bedroom as well as throughout the apartment. The bathroom is not attached to the room, but is just outside of the bedroom door. The bathroom would be exclusively yours, with the exception of if guests are over. I would have and use my own.<br><br>\nWe have PSE&amp;G and the Verizon FiOS package for cable and internet, which is split and can run between $140 and $160 monthly.<br><br>\nABOUT ME:<br>\nI am in my mid 30s and work in Manhattan at a financial services firm. I am very active during the week, whether it is the gym, or hanging out with friends. I am out of the place by 7:30am and back late in the evening. On the weekends, I head out with friends in town or in the city. I also travel from time to time. I tend to stay away from bringing the party back home, and may host the occasional pre-game; it is rare though. I am by no means a neat freak as I leave things around here and there, but try to maintain a respectful and decent living space. <br><br>\nI am looking for someone who pays the bills/rent on time and is a good person. Also looking for a non-smoker. We do not have to be the best of friends, but it would be nice if we were on the same page with the living conditions.<br><br>\nShould you have any further questions, feel free to ask. If you're interested, please respond and I will be happy to chat and set up some time to meet.<br><br>\nP.S.: We have started to packing process which is evident in the photos!<br><br><br></section>"

After 4 amazing years in the UES, I'm looking for a subletter for my bedroom in a 2BR apartment. The apartment is available from June 1st to August 31st (dates somewhat flexible). <br><br>\nThe apartment is a real 2 bedroom with amazing light, right off the new Q train and very close to the 456. Also really close to Carl Schurz park. Fairway is right around the corner and Whole Foods is a few blocks away. This area has amazing restaurants and bars. <br><br>\nThe apartment is right above a great restaurant/bar. I wouldn't recommend for very light sleepers, but totally fine if you're not a light sleeper and also in bed at 10pm on weekends.<br><br>\nMy roommate is a wonderful, early career professional and law student. She's neat and considerate and an overall wonderful person to share a home with!    </section>"

We also have roof access - it's exciting.<br><br>\nWe're a block from the Clinton-Washington C stop, a 10 minute walk from the G, and a mile away (15 min walk) from Atlantic Terminal / Barclays (B/D/N/Q/R/2/3/4/5).<br><br>\nThe master (read: huge) room: It's an absolutely beautiful 250-square-foot room with track lights, bay windows, exposed brick, a gigantic closet, and dark wood floors. $1400/month<br><br>\nThe other (read: small) room: 72-square-foot room with a closet and access to...<br>\nGlass half full: a sunny private balcony you could grow plants on, or a place to go stargazing<br>\nGlass half empty: the only fire escape in the apartment so you'd be able to save yourself. Just in case.<br>\n$975/month<br><br>\nWho we're looking for: a working professional/grad student (preferably around our age, but if you've always been told you're \"wise beyond your years,\" then this is the place for you!) who is tidy and responsible, non-smoking, maybe a little bit funny, and down for the occasional roommate bonding experience (Netflix/roof beers/Cards Against Humanity/etc).<br>\nAbout us: We're both professionals in our early-mid 20's who moved to New York with big hearts and a dream, but who are now walking and talking faster every day. Kat works in market research and enjoys baking pies, growing herbs, and mixing drinks (but doesn't bring the party home, except for sometimes...ask us about Earth Day). Emily works in marketing and enjoys eating pies that Kat makes (jk she's never had one of Kat's pies, but she's never met a pie she doesn't like), running, and reading pretentious books on the subway. We subscribe to the New Yorker and Cosmo and have been debating getting cable. Because we're fun people.    </section>"

The sublet period is from June 1 to September 15.<br><br>\nA bit about the apartment: It is located on 22nd Street in Peter Cooper Village in Gramercy. Peter Cooper is technically the same as Stuyvesant Town, same buildings, management company, etc. The Peter Cooper apartments are a bit larger and nicer, but it's all the same complex. As for the apartment itself, it's very big, especially by New York standards.  There is in an elevator in the building with laundry in the basement. The apartment is beautiful: brand new kitchen, granite countertops, marble bathroom, hardwood floors, etc. The apartment was fully renovated in in September 2011. <br><br>\nThe bedroom available is 15.5 x 10, and has an A/C unit in the room, a closet, and a window that overlooks the East River. There are hardwood floors throughout the apartment. The bedroom is un-furnished. You would need to bring a bed, a mattress, and anything else you want for your room, possibly desk, chair, curtains, dresser, etc. The common room has a couch, tv, carpet, and coffee tables. <br><br>\nI'm 29 and work in accounting. I'm usually gone from around 8:00am to 7:00pm. I am organized and like a clean apartment, so if you're messy, it probably won't work. I do not smoke and for the most part am low-key. I occasionally go out on weekends. The building I live in has many families and elderly people (as well as young people); everyone is respectfully (relatively) quiet, and I try to do the same. We don't need to be best friends, but ideally, we should get along pretty well. <br><br>\nThe rent is $1,500 per month plus cable/internet. Cable/internet run $35/month. Electricity, water, and gas are included in the rent. <br><br>\nAny questions, feel free to let me know. I'd be happy to tell you more about the apartment/myself should you have questions.<br></section>"

(already paid when we moved in last year-this is a great deal, any other place in Hoboken would charge a broker fee)<br>\n-Instead, there will be a paperwork fee from the realty office, around $170 for each new tenant.<br><br>\nUtilities:<br>\n-Heat and hot water included<br>\n-We pay electric, cable and internet, coming out to around $100/ea in the summer (depending how many a/c units), and around $40/ea the rest of the year!<br><br>\nRequirements:<br>\n-Female, preferably mid-20s<br>\n-Non-smoker<br>\n-No criminal record, no prior evictions (the realty office will automatically decline, and they will check references)<br>\n-Have good credit and/or a co-signer<br>\n-MUST be able to pay rent, security, and paperwork fee AND sign the lease by May 15th for July 1st move in (this is an absolute must, non-negotiable)<br>\n-Preferably working professionals with 9-5 or similar hours<br><br>\nAbout Me:<br>\nI am a 24 year old from the San Francisco bay area in California. I moved out here about a year ago just for a change of pace (have some family out here as well). I have lived in Hoboken since last July and work in Manhattan for a law firm full time. I love to work out, watch sports/attend games, hiking, etc. Also want to get into a Zog sports league!<br><br>\nCurrently the dynamic in our apartment is very social, and I would like to keep it that way when my roommates move out! Not interested in people who will be in their rooms all day. During the weeknights we are normally hanging around in the living room together, watching tv/netflix, eating dinner, laughing, drinking wine, etc. but go to bed at decent hours. On the weekends we go out to brunch, drinks, or sometimes do our own things, but not looking for people who bring the party home on a regular basis.<br><br>\nPlease contact me with any questions you may have, and also please include Facebook or any social media if possible. Thanks! :)    </section>"

I've been in the apartment for almost three years now and my roommate is moving out to go to California with her boyfriend. Rent is $1200 for the master bedroom. June 1st move in date. <br><br>\nBelow are some details:<br><br>\nThe Apartment - is a huge beautiful place! Lots of light. Stainless steel appliances. Living room, dining room, huge kitchen. New bathroom. The apartment is also fully furnished. <br><br>\nThe Room - The master bedroom is available for rent for $1200 for a June 1st move in date. The room is pretty big, also gets a lot of light, has two windows and a nice sized closet. Please note, this room is not furnished. <br><br>\nThe Neighborhood - We are right off of 30th Avenue in Astoria. Tons of great restaurants and bars. The grocery store is right across the street, along with a laundry mat and a pizza place. We are 2 blocks from the R/M and about a 12 minute walk to the N/Q. Very quite street with families. It's a nice neighborhood to live in. <br><br>\nRoommates - Just to give a little information about me, my name is Laurie and, like I said above, I've been in the apartment for about 3 years now, and I've been in Astoria for about 9 years. I work in the city in finance, typical 9-6 schedule. I am outgoing and friendly, I'm really clean, and I really love this apartment! I think you will too! <br><br>\nOne last and final point, I am looking for someone who can commit to a year lease. The landlord is really great and they take such good care of the property. They will be looking for someone with good credit, full time job, and who will commit to a year. <br>\nLooking forward to hearing from you!<br></section>"

The apartment has a dishwasher (!), two bathrooms (!!), skylights that let in plenty of light, and access to the roof. There's also laundry in the building. We're a few blocks away from Prospect Park and close to restaurant and shops on 7th Ave and Flatbush, with plenty of grocery stores (including the Park Slope Food Coop) a short 5-minute walk away. The apartment is 5 minutes away from the express B/Q/2/3 and about 15 minutes away from Atlantic Terminal.<br><br>\nWe are two women in our late-20s. <br>\nLADY #1 - social media producer. Exercises, sometimes. Travels for work occasionally. And spends most of her money on concerts and pad thai takeout.<br>\nLADY #2 - live events manager. Mostly out and about at the gym, with friends, exploring the city. <br><br>\nWe are both clean, easy-going people. We have busy personal and professional lives, but enjoy quiet evenings at home during the week. Looking for someone who has a similar lifestyle, but also enjoys occasionally sharing a bottle of wine and swapping war stories. <br><br>\nThe room is available as of June 1, and we're looking for someone to sign onto the lease, which ends on August 31, 2017. We love this apartment and hope to renew the lease for another year, from September 1, 2017 to August 31, 2018. The room is $1140 a month. Utilities are usually about another $70. The security deposit is $1208.33.<br><br>\nNo pets, no couples.<br></section>"

It's located on the first floor of a fantastic duplex apartment. \u2028 <br><br>\nMy Apartment \u2028 <br>\nThe apartment is a rare-find in Crown Heights - it's a top floor duplex, with 2 full bathrooms and a front facing balcony.

Utilities (including heat, hot water, electric and cable) are included in the price of rent.  <br><br>\nThe Neighborhood \u2028 <br>\nCrown Heights is a great neighborhood because it is quiet, safe, clean, fun and easily accessible to Eastern Parkway, St. Johns, Atlantic Avenue, and Fulton Street. The neighborhood has changed significantly since I initially moved in and continues to improve. Subway Stops include - Crown Heights, Utica on the 4 and Utica Ave on the A train.

We're looking for two new tenants to sign a one-year lease and move into our fantastic, sunny 5-bedroom, 2.5 bathroom Upper West Side apartment on June 1st. True queen-size private bedrooms...no fake walls or anything. Large living room, huge kitchen, laundry in the building, live-in super. The common areas are completely furnished.<br><br>\nThe two tenants moving out are one girl and one guy, moving out of the area or in with a significant other. The original leaseholders signed the lease more than 10 years ago and it's been passed down throughout the years. It's truly a hidden gem in Manhattan. I love this place and you will, too.<br><br>\nThe bedrooms each have a tall closet, large window and can hold a queen size bed and a dresser comfortably. <br><br>\nThe apartment is located on the corner of West 96th and Broadway, a 30-second walk to the 1-2-3 express trains: a 5-minute ride to Times Square, 8-minute ride to 14th Street, and 15-minutes to Wall Street. You'll be at 30 Rock in about 10 minutes! We've got all the major banks within a one block radius, Westside Market one block away, and Whole Foods 3 blocks away. We're right between Central Park and Riverside Park. <br><br>\nYour rent will be $1,350 plus utilities (cable/wifi/electric)<br><br>\nThe roommates: all three are young professionals in our mid/late-20's working in media. We like to have a good time but don't bring the party home. The females share one bathroom and the males share another, so there's never any awkward interactions.<br><br>\nWe love this place and we're looking forward to welcoming you into our home! Please reach out with a brief bio and a link to your Facebook/LinkedIn profile.    </section>"

The apartment is a 4 bedroom, 1 bath apartment. The bedroom is very large with lots of windows and beautiful light. I am moving out permanently, so will be taking most of my stuff with me, but I can be flexible depending on what you need. The lease on the apartment is up at the end of July. <br><br>\nRent is $1175 for the month + 1/4 of the utilities. The building is clean and well kept with a live-in super, and is a 10 minute walk to Columbia University and 5 minute walk to the subway.<br><br>\nMy roommates:<br>\nMy roommates are great. They are your typical 20 something students at Columbia: a female graduate student studying environmental science, a female graduate student at Columbia studying film, and a male graduate student studying law.<br>\nIdeally, you too are a young professional or student who understands the demands a job or school in this city can bring. It's also important not to be messy but don't have to be a clean freak. Dishes shouldn't pile up. And it's important that everyone pitches in to make sure things stay clean. No drugs. No live-in boyfriends/girlfriends. We welcome gals/guys and gay or straight. Bottom line: We're hard working, laid-back and very easy to get along with.<br><br>\nLet me know if you're interested!    </section>"

I'm in the market for a roommate, ideally a woman or a gay/queer man, for one room in my 2 bedroom apartment in the heart of Williamsburg for a June 1 move in. The room is $1275 per month. It is a small room for sure, about 6x10, but it's cozy and it fits a good deal. I lived in this room for six years and it fit a full bed, a dresser, a bookshelf, and a nightstand, for reference. The room is in the back of the apartment and looks out onto a lovely, quiet garden.<br><br>\nJust as a price reference point - the rooms in the back house on this property are the exact same size, but are $1500!! <br><br>\nI've lived here for seven years and it's a great apartment off the Bedford stop on the L. It's on the ground floor, it has a huge kitchen, a washer in the unit, and a really nice garden in the back with a table and chairs, perfect for drinking wine during the summer. I have a roku with hulu, netflix, amazon prime, hbo, starz, cinemax, and showtime on it that you're free to use. The location literally couldn't be better -- its 2 blocks from the Bedford L stop, around the corner from Smorgasburg (which just opened again for the season, hurray!), a block from the ferry and the river, and close to tons of great bars and restaurants. I've literally never had a bad meal in this neighborhood. We're seriously in the BEST location! :)<br><br>\nThere's only two other apartments in the building, and all the tenants are really nice and have also been in the building for several years.<br><br>\nI'm a 33 year old woman and work at Etsy in the legal department. I'm also a theater director/producer, meaning that if I'm not in rehearsal for something at night, I usually keep it pretty chill on the evenings.<br><br>\nI'm looking for someone in their 20's or 30's who just wants a nice, calm place to live. Someone who's got their own stuff going on, but might also want to hang out and watch Game of Thrones, or make fun of a lifetime movie with me. No smokers, no hard drug users.<br><br>\nYou would also be roommates with my cat, Dennis. He enjoys napping, watching birds in the garden, and knocking every toy he's ever been given under the stove.<br><br>\nIf you're interested, shoot me a message to tell me a little bit about yourself and send any relevant social media if you have it. :) I will be setting up appointments ASAP. Thanks!!    </section>"

We have one room available in our 3-bed, 2 bath apartment. The room is a great size, able to fit a full size bed, vanity, dresser and more! The apartment is in a doorman building in downtown Hoboken, a 5-minute walk from the path, and includes a gym, laundry room, and a sundeck with grills. Parking is available for an additional fee. The room is available July 1st, with the possibility of a mid-June move in if needed. <br><br>\nAbout us: We are easy going, down to earth and looking for the same in a future roommate! We are hoping to find someone we get along with easily, and who might be interested in the occasional glass of wine etc. If this sounds like you, send an email with a little about yourselves and a link to social media.<br><br>\nLooking forward to meeting you!    </section>"

And this summer, it could all be yours!<br><br>\nI am leaving NYC from June 7ish to August 7ish (dates are flexible), and I am looking for someone to sublet my room for that time. <br><br>\nThe apartment:<br>\nRent is $900/mo + utilities/internet (about $60-80 per person depending upon the weather). <br>\nWe have a very large living room area with a sectional couch, projector, record player, and many plants + a dining room table with soft lighting (soft lighting only in this house). <br>\nWe have a small front yard and good-sized backyard. There are trees in both yards! We have grass, we have a fire pit. The yard situation is pretty ideal. There are three bedrooms - one bedroom has its own bathroom, but your room shares a bathroom with one other person (who is lovely). We're equidistant from the Franklin C and Classon G (10 minute walk), and the B52 stops at our corner, so that's helpful.<br><br>\nThe room:<br>\n-See pictures!<br>\n-queen sized bed!<br>\n- really nice light<br>\n- your choice of either large chest of drawers or closet for storing your stuff. <br>\n- i'll even leave my tibetan salt lamp and essential oil diffuser for you<br>\n- it's always quiet. Our neighbors are very chill, and there's not much noise besides birds singin. <br><br>\nMy roommates: <br>\n-two 20s/early 30s queers, both of whom work and socialize out of the house much of the time. <br>\n-enjoy relaxing at home/having folks over for dinner/hanging out with friends/watching movies in the space, but are gone/busy often, <br>\n-are extremely considerate about shared space<br><br>\nThe animals: <br>\n1) my dog, Pickle, who will be cared for my roommate and will lick your face and sit on you. Must love dogs. <br>\n2) Beaujangles - he's a cat, he belongs to my roommate, and he has one eye. He's v v sweet and will also sit on you. Must be pretty cool with cats.<br><br>\nYou: <br>\n- queer or you are familiar with and adore queerness and queer people.<br>\n- good politics. Please don't come into our house believing or saying things that negate other people's humanity, pls. <br>\n- **considerate, kind, and tidy** -- my roommates do their part to keep shared spaces uncluttered and the sink relatively clear, and are kind and good communicators, which makes everything a little easier - please be willing to do the same.<br>\n- willing and able to pay rent/utilities on time.<br><br>\nThat's all for now, but please get in touch if this is what you're looking for and we'll talk about dates and see if we're all a good fit!<br></section>"

The room has it's own private entrance to the building's staircase, as well as access from the original iron spiral staircase in the living room. The bathroom is nice and bright with blue tiles and lots of light from the windows-- you also have a fire escape here which is great for the summertime. Downstairs you have a nice sized living room and kitchen with 1 other bedroom with her own private bathroom.<br><br>\nMove-in date is preferably June 1st.<br>\n15 minute walk to the Path and tons of restaurants and shops within 5-10 mins walking. Park and dog park not even two blocks away as well as Acme two blocks away.<br><br>\nRent is $960/ month plus utilities around $100 pp split between 3 girls. Central air is a plus (no AC window units).<br><br>\nThe girls are low-key, clean and professional females in their mid-20's. If you enjoy a cute, furnished home with a separation of your bedroom from the rest of the living spaces then you'll really enjoy this room.<br><br>\nSend me an email so we can set up a time for you to come see the space!    </section>"

The room comfortably fits a queen bed, bookshelf, desk and dresser. Large closet in the room and your own second closet by the front door of the apartment for coats, extra storage, etc. Room has wood floors and two windows, one east and one south facing. Amazing light.<br><br>\nThe rest of the apartment is an open layout. We have a TV with Roku, high-speed internet. Kitchen, bathroom, etc recently renovated. Wood floors throughout. Utilities (gas, electric, wi-fi) end up around $75/month. We do not have central air, so an A/C unit is recommended.<br><br>\nLocated on Franklin Ave, this apartment is in a very hip, fun, convenient area. 2/3/4/5 trains are 5 mins away, the S shuttle is 1/2 block, and the C is 7 mins. A is 11 mins. The B48 and B44 are also very close, in case you're heading north to Williamsburg. 25 mins to Union Square. Botanical gardens, BK museum, Prospect park, Grand army plaza farmer's market all a short walk away. Such a great area!<br><br>\nRoommates are both early 30's, low key, chill, responsible, respectful, friends before living together. Both POCs and 420 friendly. Hoping for the same in the new roomie. <br><br>\nTake a look at the photos and let us know if you're interested. The room is available for June 1st and we're hoping for a long-term subletter, ideally, at least 6 months. No lease or background check required. Basic sublease agreement. <br><br>\nNeed 1 month deposit and rent to move-in.<br><br>\nAlso, no pets please. Couples maybe, but there would be increase in the rent to adjust for an additional person in the flat, so heads up on that. If you have living room furniture like coffee table or art for the walls or what have you, we can make room. <br><br><br></section>"

It's a 2bdrm, 5th floor walkup apartment on 120th street. It's a great block in an amazing neighborhood with a real community feel. Friendly neighbors and some fantastic restaurants near by. From Dirty Taco to Little Bamboo Sushi, to Paris Blues if you like a good dive bar with old school live music. Also a short walk from Red Rooster, Corner Social, Harlem Shake and the new Whole Foods which is opening on 125th this summer. Also a short walk to all of the great restaurants on Frederick Douglas Blvd. Blink Fitness is a short walk in one direction. Planet Fitness is another couple of blocks in the other direction. 2/3 subway stops are right there at 116 and about 20 minutes to Times Square.<br><br>\nRoomate is a cool, older guy who promotes events around town. He was born and raised in Harlem and knows everything and everyone. Will tell you some great stories and clue you in to anything you can want to know going on in the neighborhood.<br><br>\nI'm moving out because I got a great deal with a friend of a friend in a different neighborhood and trying to cut my budget while building a new business. Honestly, when I get to a good place with that I'll probably move right back to this same block if I am able. <br><br>\nThe agreement is month to month but ideally someone should stay at least 6 months. Can make exceptions, depending. Also, while I have paid through end of May, I may possibly be out by around the 17th, so if you want to move in earlier we can work it out and you'd just pay me the prorated earlier days. Otherwise, one month security deposit plus first month and last month to move in. $3600 total.<br><br>\nAnd everything is included except cable/internet which comes to about $70/month.<br><br>\nPlease mention a little about yourself when writing. Thanks!    </section>"

Ideally, I'm looking for a young professional fem @le starting between Jun - August 1 and signing until August 1, 2018. Our official lease ends Aug 1st, 2017 so if anyone moved in Jun or July, they would sign a 2/1 month sublet and then we'd re-sign a year lease starting August 1, 2017. Rent is $1250 a month plus utilities (max $150 a month) w/ a $250 security deposit.<br><br>\nFew things about the building/apt:<br><br>\nI love living here! It's a beautiful, bright apartment with top of the line appliances, high ceilings, huge bathrooms, wood floors, spacious kitchen, full size washer and dryer in the apt and all other luxury amenities (gym, pool, movie room,etc). I included a picture from the website outlining all the details of the apartment and building. Also, if you ride the train everyday, the shuttle to the train station saves me about $200 a month in parking! I've lived here going on 2.5 years now and have no complaints. Feel free to google the building to get a better look at amenities and restaurants/stores in the building. <br><br><br>\nFew things about the room:<br><br>\nThe room for rent in a \"guest\" bedroom (not the master, but same sq footage, left side of layout pic). Floor to ceiling windows, large closet and large bathroom (with linen closet). Living room and kitchen are fully furnished and stocked (kitchen table, chairs, couch, tv, rug, etc) so there might not be a lot of room for more furniture in the common areas. Rented room is the 12' 6\" x 11'ft.<br><br>\nIdeally, no pets but can be negotiated. There is an additional $50 charge a month.<br><br>\nFew things about me:<br><br>\nI'm a 26 year old, fem @le, financial professional at a company in Stamford. I love shopping, going to brunch, the beach or yoga/gym. I love happy hours and watching all things on Bravo Tv. I am respectful, very clean and don't like a lot of mess. I'm pretty low key on weekends so would like someone who was similar in that regard. <br><br>\nFew things about who I'm looking for:<br><br>\nI'm looking for a fem@le in her 20s, who is fun, nice, responsible and respectful. Non-smoking please. Full employment is a must and background and financial credit is checked to qualify for lease.<br><br>\nFinancials:<br>\nRent: $1250 (includes: amenity fee, parking, and trash)<br>\nElectric: $45<br>\nGas: $25<br>\nWater: $8<br>\nCable/Internet: $70<br><br>\nPlease email me if interested and include a little about yourself. We can set up a time to meet, go over some details and have you see the place. Thanks!    </section>"

    "<section id=\"postingbody\"><div class=\"print-information print-qrcode-container\">\n            <p class=\"print-qrcode-label\">QR Code Link to This Post</p>\n            <div class=\"print-qrcode\" data-location=\"//newhaven.craigslist.org/roo/6112480993.html\"></div>\n        </div>\nHi -<br><br>\nMy current roommate is moving to NYC this summer for a job so I'm looking for someone to fill her spot! Ideally, I'm looking for a young professional fem @le starting between Jun - August 1 and signing until August 1, 2018. Our official lease ends Aug 1st, 2017 so if anyone moved in Jun or July, they would sign a 2/1 month sublet and then we'd re-sign a year lease starting August 1, 2017. Rent is $1250 a month plus utilities (max $150 a month) w/ a $250 security deposit.<br><br>\nFew things about the building/apt:<br><br>\nI love living here! It's a beautiful, bright apartment with top of the line appliances, high ceilings, huge bathrooms, wood floors, spacious kitchen, full size washer and dryer in the apt and all other luxury amenities (gym, pool, movie room,etc). I included a picture from the website outlining all the details of the apartment and building. Also, if you ride the train everyday, the shuttle to the train station saves me about $200 a month in parking! I've lived here going on 2.5 years now and have no complaints. Feel free to google the building to get a better look at amenities and restaurants/stores in the building. <br><br><br>\nFew things about the room:<br><br>\nThe room for rent in a \"guest\" bedroom (not the master, but same sq footage, left side of layout pic). Floor to ceiling windows, large closet and large bathroom (with linen closet). Living room and kitchen are fully furnished and stocked (kitchen table, chairs, couch, tv, rug, etc) so there might not be a lot of room for more furniture in the common areas. Rented room is the 12' 6\" x 11'ft.<br><br>\nIdeally, no pets but can be negotiated. There is an additional $50 charge a month.<br><br>\nFew things about me:<br><br>\nI'm a 26 year old, fem @le, financial professional at a company in Stamford. I love shopping, going to brunch, the beach or yoga/gym. I love happy hours and watching all things on Bravo Tv. I am respectful, very clean and don't like a lot of mess. I'm pretty low key on weekends so would like someone who was similar in that regard. <br><br>\nFew things about who I'm looking for:<br><br>\nI'm looking for a fem@le in her 20s, who is fun, nice, responsible and respectful. Non-smoking please. Full employment is a must and background and financial credit is checked to qualify for lease.<br><br>\nFinancials:<br>\nRent: $1250 (includes: amenity fee, parking, and trash)<br>\nElectric: $45<br>\nGas: $25<br>\nWater: $8<br>\nCable/Internet: $70<br><br>\nPlease email me if interested and include a little about yourself. We can set up a time to meet, go over some details and have you see the place. Thanks!    </section>"

Her room is available starting June 1st.  <br><br>\nThis is a lovely apartment with two closets by the entrance, a common closet near the bedrooms, built in storage cabinets in the hall, and closets in both bedrooms.  We are not short on space!  Eat in kitchen, front hall, and a massive living room.<br><br>\nIf you have a car, the building rents garage space for I think $125.  <br><br>\nBills are not included and come to about $100 a month.  Average for internet, gas, electric. <br><br>\nA ten minute walk from Cortelyou Q stop, and twelve minutes from Newkirk B,Q.  Ditmas is known for its beautiful Victorian mansions, and while ours is a large apartment building (rent stabilized btw), I do love to marvel at the homes on my walk to and from the train.  <br><br>\nYou'd be sharing the apartment with myself and one very active cat.  We're very clean, you'd never even know there was a litter box.  My cat gets along with other cats, but if you were to bring one, you'd have to be really on top of it.  <br><br>\nAs for me, I'm a scenic painter working in theatre and commercial fashion/TV/events.  I freelance, but it's pretty steady. Sometimes I work 100 hour weeks, sometimes 20. It all depends on the season.  I'm 36 and would prefer to live with someone also in their 30s, or there about. Gender and orientation doesn't matter.  My last two roommates were both in industries that required working well with groups of people, and I'd like to keep that trend going. If you're easy going, clean, and you can pay rent on time I'd love to meet you! Come on by any evening this week or weekend and let's meet! <br><br>\nGood luck in your search everybody! <br><br>\nPictures to come.    </section>"

The monthly rent is $1350 plus utilities - with all the amenities (gym, laundry) and size, this is a great deal for Crown Heights. <br><br>\nMove-in date is flexible for a few days, just let us know!<br><br>\nSPECS<br><br>\nThe apartment is huge: around 1300 sqft! Southern facing, 2 bedrooms, separate kitchen, walk-in hall closet, and Juliet balcony with ample sunlight. The living/dining room is super spacious, with a little bar area and a cozy reading nook.<br><br>\nThe room itself is almost 200 sqft, with two closets (!), and three windows that get a ton of sun during the daytime. Because we have two bathrooms, you'd get your very own bathroom, although we do share the shower. <br><br>\nTHE ROOMMATE <br><br>\nYour roommate is in her late 20's and works a 9-5 in advertising. We like to hang out after work and on the weekends, but someone who can keep normal hours is preferred. <br><br>\nJust so you know, preference will be given to: those who watch The Bachelor ironically but secretly not, fans of RuPaul's Drag Race and Game of Thrones, wine, traveling, bikes, and all different types of music. <br><br>\nAMENITIES<br><br>\nCommon Spaces: We have a Smart TV, Amazon Alexa, couch, etc. There's a record player too, if you're into that, and the kitchen is stocked with equipment.<br><br>\nBedroom: I am selling my full-size IKEA bed &amp; mattress, dresser, desk, &amp; bookshelf for cheap/negotiable (or can get rid of them if you don't want them.)<br><br>\nThe building has elevators, laundry, and a small fitness center. Parking is available for a monthly fee - it's less than $200/month, which if you know this neighborhood is a steal.<br><br>\nWHERE<br><br>\nTrains: 2/3/4/5 @ Franklin, 3 @ Nostrand Ave, A/C at Nostrand Ave. B44 runs express to Williamsburg. <br><br>\nThe apartment is located in between the bars and restaurants of Franklin Ave and the Caribbean restaurants, grocery stores, and more bars on Nostrand Ave. It's also within walking distance of Prospect Park, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and Brooklyn Museum and Library.<br><br>\nREQUIREMENTS:<br><br>\n1st month's rent &amp; security deposit<br>\n$40 application fee through the management company. They also ask that you make 40x your share of the rent.<br>\nOther women only, please<br>\nAlcohol, 420, etc is cool <br>\nUnfortunately no cats or dogs<br><br>\nIF YOU'RE INTERESTED:<br><br>\nEmail us a bit about yourself, interests, job, and somewhere you've visited lately that you loved and we'll get back to you!    </section>"

Please no couples. I'm looking for a long-term roommate who would be comfortable signing a 1-year lease. I do have a small dog who's friendly, but unfortunately the space isn't quite large enough for any other animals.<br><br>\nThe apartment is a newly renovated 2 bed, 1 bath on a sunny 3rd floor of a limestone in PLG. Appliances are stainless steel and there is a dishwasher. (Pics don't reflect some upgrades) You'd have your own room with a closet and we'd share a living / dining area / kitchen and bathroom.<br><br>\nCoin-operated laundry is on the 1st floor of the building.<br><br>\nThe apartment is a 1 minute walk to the Q train @ Parkside Ave, a 10 minute walk to the B and Shuttle @ Prospect Park and about 15 mins walking to the 2/5 @ Winthrop. Prospect Park is a 2 minute walk (literally!) and there are tons of eateries and bars within walking distance.<br><br>\n$1400 covers rent. Wifi/ electricity/ etc are about $50 a month extra and if we decide, we would split the cost of a cleaning person every few weeks.<br><br>\nYou will be required to provide a $50 application fee for a credit check if you're interested in the apartment.<br><br>\nTo schedule a viewing please shoot me an email or text.    </section>"

Ideally, I'm looking for a young professional fem @le starting between Jun - August 1 and signing until August 1, 2018. Our official lease ends Aug 1st, 2017 so if anyone moved in Jun or July, they would sign a 2/1 month sublet and then we'd re-sign a year lease starting August 1, 2017. Rent is $1250 a month plus utilities (max $150 a month) w/ a $250 security deposit.<br><br>\nFew things about the building/apt:<br><br>\nI love living here! It's a beautiful, bright apartment with top of the line appliances, high ceilings, huge bathrooms, wood floors, spacious kitchen, full size washer and dryer in the apt and all other luxury amenities (gym, pool, movie room,etc). I included a picture from the website outlining all the details of the apartment and building. Also, if you ride the train everyday, the shuttle to the train station saves me about $200 a month in parking! I've lived here going on 2.5 years now and have no complaints. Feel free to google the building to get a better look at amenities and restaurants/stores in the building. <br><br><br>\nFew things about the room:<br><br>\nThe room for rent in a \"guest\" bedroom (not the master, but same sq footage, left side of layout pic). Floor to ceiling windows, large closet and large bathroom (with linen closet). Living room and kitchen are fully furnished and stocked (kitchen table, chairs, couch, tv, rug, etc) so there might not be a lot of room for more furniture in the common areas. Rented room is the 12' 6\" x 11'ft.<br><br>\nIdeally, no pets but can be negotiated. There is an additional $50 charge a month.<br><br>\nFew things about me:<br><br>\nI'm a 26 year old, fem @le, financial professional at a company in Stamford. I love shopping, going to brunch, the beach or yoga/gym. I love happy hours and watching all things on Bravo Tv. I am respectful, very clean and don't like a lot of mess. I'm pretty low key on weekends so would like someone who was similar in that regard. <br><br>\nFew things about who I'm looking for:<br><br>\nI'm looking for a fem@le in her 20s, who is fun, nice, responsible and respectful. Non-smoking please. Full employment is a must and background and financial credit is checked to qualify for lease.<br><br>\nFinancials:<br>\nRent: $1250 (includes: amenity fee, parking, and trash)<br>\nElectric: $45<br>\nGas: $25<br>\nWater: $8<br>\nCable/Internet: $70<br><br>\nPlease email me if interested and include a little about yourself. We can set up a time to meet, go over some details and have you see the place. Thanks!    </section>"

The apartment is large and lovely... lots of books and pretty rugs and instruments and stuff like that.  It's a doorman building and there's a dishwasher in the kitchen and laundry on the ground floor.  There's a lot of light, too.  The apartment is very close to lovely bars and restaurants on Cortelyou Road and is a short bus or subway ride (or jog if you're feeling ambitious) to Prospect Park.  The apartment is in between the Q (Cortelyou) and F (Ditmas) lines and is near many express busses.  <br><br>\nYou would be living with a wonderful guy in his late thirties who is hilarious, kind, and courteous.  He leaves the house early each morning to practice yoga and is a pleasure to live with.<br><br>\nIf you are interested in this apartment, please email me asap with a little information about yourself and who you are in this world.<br><br>\nThanks!    </section>"

Neighborhood has a bookstore, 24-hour bodegas, laundromat, Crunch Gym, caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants etc. Ft Greene Park is 3 blocks away and Prospect Park (where I go running) is less than a mile to the south.<br><br>\nRoommate:<br><br>\nI'm a 40-year old male, with a warm and friendly personality. I work in Accounting so my hours are a standard 9-6pm. I'm easy going and expect the same - someone fairly mature who is conscientious about cleaning up after themselves and respectful. I think it's nice to feel a sense of community so I'm always happy to chat but also respect the need for privacy. I rarely have multiple guests over, but I enjoy baking homemade pizzas and will host the occasional dinner party.<br><br>\nThe rent is $1215 plus utilities (Con Ed and Spectrum high speed internet) which average about $70/month. To setup an appointment to view the apartment, please send a reply with a short description of yourself. Proof of income, 1st month's rent and security deposit of $1215 are required prior to move in.<br></section>"

We have a room for rent in our 3 bedroom apt that we'd like to fill by the 1st of June or possibly a day or two sooner if you need to. I work in the film/tv industry, which means catering as well. Elliott hosts his own talk show and is focused on his photography and music career. We're pretty laid back and social but respectful of other peoples space and belongings. We have a lot of plants and some awesome turtles, but no cat or dog. <br><br>\nThe neighborhood is great, I've been here almost 15 years now, and I really feel like a part of the community. There are a ton of spanish, indian, thai, diner, chinese, etc delivery in the area that are both delicious and inexpensive. A lot of great new restaurants and bars have sprung up around here too. Parks in multiple directions, as well as beautiful jogging paths. You can walk to City College and a quick train ride to Columbia.<br><br>\nThe room is 15'x13' with a sizable closet, partially furnished. The apt has hardwood floors, big windows, tall ceilings, separate living room, kitchen, 1 bathroom. We recently redid the kitchen floor and are pretty stoked about it. We're on the 4th floor and the building has an elevator. We have a nice view from the fire escape to see downtown. We get tons of sun all over the apt. It's got a really nice pre-war feel to it. The heat is great in winter, and the shower pressure and hot water is always on point. I also built a table in our kitchen that you can see in the picture. We get creative around here from time to time... <br><br>\nThe bills include $900 a month rent, plus gas/electric, plus cable/internet. We have dvr, wired &amp; wireless internet, ondemand of a couple premium channels and a nice big tv, xbox1 with a bunch of apps, usually ends up being around $100 to $125 a month in utilities. To move in requires an additional month's deposit (1st month + deposit = $1800 total). <br><br>\n445 w.153rd st. Apt 4D <br>\nBetween St. Nicholas and Amsterdam Aves<br>\nClosest Train is 155th on the C line @ St. Nicholas <br>\nA, B, C, &amp; D Trains at 145th &amp; St. Nicholas (A &amp; D Express trains get you to 42nd st in under 30 minutes) <br>\n1 train on 157th &amp; Broadway <br>\nDO NOT go to the 155th stop on the B train (you'd have to walk up a humongous stairway) <br><br>\nI'd like to show the apt on Sunday May 7th, but may be able to arrange another time this week, time permitting. Get in touch with a number I can reach you at and include in your reply when a good time is for you to come see the apt. Thanks for your interest and good luck with your search! <br><br>\n-Vince    </section>"

Looking for a submitter for a fully-furnished, cozy bedroom in a 3 bedroom apartment starting June 1. The room is very comfortable for one person, and comes equipped with a bed, closet, desk, nightstand, and a small dresser. The apartment features updated kitchen and bathroom appliances, ample lighting, exposed brick, central A/C, and a relatively spacious layout (none of the bedrooms share walls with each other!). <br><br>\nThe apartment is very easily accessible -- only 2 blocks from the Wilson L, and about a 10 minute walk to the Chauncey J. Only 2 stops in either direction to the Myrtle-Wyckoff M or the A-C-E-J-Z at Broadway Junction. Around the corner are several coffee shops and bars (Father Knows Best, Routine, Nowadays), as well as plenty of corner groceries and laundromats. <br><br>\nThe room will be available to sublet through the end of July, with the possibility to extend the lease in August. The furniture will be available for sale to someone looking to extend the lease. Rent for the room is $800/mo. plus utilities.<br><br>\nAdditionally, the two other rooms in this apartment will also be up for sublet on June 1/lease renewal on August 1. I'm happy to give more info to those interested in this room and/or the apartment as a whole.    </section>"

While the room and apartment are cozy (the room can best fit a twin/full size bed), it is in a prime downtown location on the border of SoHo and the South Village. It is within quick walking distance of multiple train lines (Spring Street 'C', Prince Street 'N/W/R', Varick Street '1,\" Broadway-Lafayette 'B/D/F/M'). It is also within walking distance of every amenity you can think of  prime SoHo shopping, Greenwich/West Village entertainment and restaurants, movie theaters, bars, etc. It's also a 5-minute walk to Washington Square Park, a 15-minute walk to the Hudson River, and a 10-minute walk to Union Square, which gets you to Williamsburg and Bushwick in no time. While the neighborhood itself always has a lot going on, the street my apartment is on is actually very quiet at night. This is a great place to live if you are looking to be out and about most of the time and want quick access to everything in NYC <br><br>\nThe room itself has a small closet and also an amazing fire escape with views of both the Empire State building and 1 World Trade that is lovely to sit on in the summer. You would be sharing the apartment with my roommate who is very quiet and clean; he graduated with me from the University of Chicago and works in tech. The apartment has a kitchen with lots of counter space, and a bathroom. The room does not come furnished.<br><br>\nI would require a security deposit of $1,300 which could be used towards the last month's rent, if all works out.    </section>"

Can you sign a one-year lease starting June 1 with two other roommates?? (Us!)(Two female roommates that Craigslist brought together one year ago!) Right, yes, great! Please see attached pics! (Bed in pics is a queen.)<br><br>\nThe apartment is v. cute, in between the Franklin C and the Franklin 2/3/4/5; b65 and b48 buses stop on the corner; close to stuff, including bars like Friends and Lovers, Crown Inn, Covenhoven; a new Foodtown; the brooklyn museum; one really bad diner and one really good diner; and the corner of Vanderbilt Ave and Bergen St. where Louis Tomlinson was spotted three months ago. If you have a car, we have street parking! If you like to grill, we have a big backyard (that we only share with one other apt)! we also have a dishwasher and a cookie jar. <br><br>\nWe are cool and nice; we are in media and publishing, respectively; we are clean-ish; we have two cats (but please no other pets). The room is $1100 a month plus utilities, which are reasonable. we split Con Ed, Natl Grid, and internet, and utils usually come out to an additional $60-$100 a month. <br><br>\nplease be in touch! Tell us a little about yourself and let us know when you can swing by to look at the place this week after work, Tue-Thu nights from around 7p to before 10p.    </section>"

A little early to advertise but just in case someone is already looking for September - I am not available through the summer after the end of May so I would like to show the room now for September move in. STILL AVAILABLE IF POSTING IS UP. For male to share apartment with one other male - only myself. Upper West Side. Probably most ideal and convenient area in all Manhattan to live in for everything. The West 72nd Street/Broadway subway is right next door (#1, 2 and 3 trains). Very clean, quiet, comfortable, well-furnished private room. Medium size - about 11'x11'. Share extra large eat-in-kitchen (I use it very little) and bathroom with one person (myself). Layout of apartment provides excellent privacy for each person - the closest thing to living alone. The two sleeping areas are very far apart and totally independent with many enclosing doors, separate ways to enter, etc. Own cable TV, A/C, wireless internet available. Laundry in building. Excellent well-maintained elevator building. Ideal for professional or student (very convenient for Columbia) seeking quiet environment who does not have a lot with them. The room is very fully furnished already and couldn't accommodate more furniture. $1295/month plus one month security and half utilities, but cable TV included. Non-smoking, no pets. Please reply with a little about yourself if you like - working, student, etc. No photos available now. I'd like to show it to those available to see it personally as soon as possible in May.    </section>"
