Don't worry if you haven't read them, we won't judge you, we'll just quietly feel badly that your childhood was clearly almost entirely devoid of meaning.<br>\n<br>\nMany fantastic humans with wildly different backgrounds, ideas, and passions have called Redwall home over the last four years, and much magic has been made over potluck dinners, themed gatherings, and spontaneous moments born sitting by the fire, around the piano, or in the never-ending nooks and crannies that emerge out of our bizarrely long and slightly disorienting hallway. We have a large common area and generally throw a couple large events each year, and really enjoy hosting people for group dinners. We keep the apartment tidy, and occasionally chip in for deeper cleaning. The atmosphere here is laid back - we all have lots going on with school, work, and play and value coming home to a place that feels easy, warm, and supportive.<br>\n<br>\nWe're located directly across the street from the Divinity School, a stone's throw from Marsh Botanic Gardens, Prospect Gardens, and the Yale Farm, and an easy walk to East Rock, Downtown, Wooster Square and many more great places. We are also located directly on the Yale Shuttle and New Haven Transit bus lines, with stops right outside the door. We also have a very large parking lot behind the building where you can park for free if you are bringing a car and a secure indoor bike storage room.<br>\n<br>\nThe apartment is extraordinarily large, and is really more like a house. We have an enormous living room with a fireplace, spacious formal dining room, two-room kitchen and pantry that have been recently renovated and have brand-new appliances, and the bedrooms are all very big. The apartment gets fantastic light, and many of the rooms boast spectacular unobstructed views of West Rock park. There also is a new washer/dryer in the apartment that is free to use. The entire apartment has been updated, but still retains its historic charm, with beautiful old details throughout. We really love it here!<br>\n<br>\nSadly many of our beloved roommates are graduating this year and moving onto bigger and better things (except for their new housing, which will almost certainly be smaller and shittier than Redwall). We will have four bedrooms available for rent starting in August/September and one room available starting in January. All rooms are $635/month, which includes heat and hot water. We split internet, electric, and gas evenly each month. Though our lease runs on the academic calendar and we are located on the Yale campus, we are a home for both students and professionals and are open to renting to anybody whether or not they are a student or affiliated with the university. We are excited to continue our tradition of bringing together people with diverse backgrounds and interests so we can keep learning from each other and broadening our horizons.<br>\n<br>\nAs mentioned, we have a dog and two cats. If you are an animal lover, they are fantastic companions. They are all mellow and sweet and do not typically provoke allergies for people. However, if you are sensitive to animals, or really dislike animal hair, this is probably not the place for you. We may be able to accommodate another small dog (and our medium dog would be thrilled). Our feline overlords, however, will not tolerate any other cats and have sworn merciless vengeance should we even whisper about such things. So don't ask if you can bring your cat.<br>\n<br>\nIf you're interested in living with us, send us a paragraph about yourself and we can go from there.    </section>"

This is a really great apartment in an awesome area and is such a great deal. <br>\n<br>\nAbout the apartment: <br>\nThis is a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in a 3 unit walk-up building. The apartment is located on the 3rd floor. The landlord lives on the 1st and 2nd floors with his family and another family lives on the 4th floor. There is FREE washer/dryer (2 washers, 2 dryers) in the basement. The building is situated in a great location and easily accessible to the A, B, C, D, 2, 3. The block is incredibly adorable and is in a row of historic brownstones (there are annual block parties, monthly block meetings, and neighborhood beautification initiatives to plant flowers around the trees along the sidewalks). <br>\n<br>\nAbout the room: <br>\nI'm looking for someone to takeover my room which is a private bedroom with a private bathroom. The room is the smallest room in the apartment but that's why you get the private bathroom and pay the same amount as each roommate. The room is about 10'x10' with enough room to fit a Queen bed (I have one and it's pictured). I am also selling the bed (which is a great memory foam mattress that has been bagged and protected carefully to prevent bed bugs since I bought it two years ago), bed frame, curtains, ikea black 6x6 shelf and basically anything you see in the photos including the etagere in the bathroom with baskets. We can talk a bundle price if you're interested in any of those things. <br>\n<br>\nThe apartment's common areas are spacious (you can see the living room) and there's a full kitchen. There's air conditioning and heat as well as an intercom system in the apartment for your late night food deliveries. The entire apartment is laid out in hardwood flooring except for the bathrooms where there's tiling. Utilities typically run ~$80-120/month per person including Internet. <br>\n<br>\nAbout the roommates: <br>\nI have two roommates both in their mid to late 20s. One guy, One girl. They're both working professionals (one is a nurse, the other is a computer engineer) and are incredibly considerate about common areas. We all mostly do our own thing and keep to ourselves but will occasionally hang out for happy hours and roommate excursions/scrabble. <br>\n<br>\nAbout you: <br>\nYou must have good credit and be a considerate and clean person. You should also have a gross income that is at least 2.5X the rent. Our landlord values having good people as tenants especially since he lives in the building with his family, so we're looking for responsible, clean, and nice people. We don't throw raging parties and we take care of the apartment (which is why our rent has stayed the same for several years now and we want to keep it that way!)<br>\n<br>\nI'm leaving the apartment May 31st so move-in is available anytime after that. You'd be signing a new 1-year lease with my other two roommates. If you're interested please tell me about yourself and write Harlem Rocks somewhere in the subject line. <br>\n<br>\nThanks and happy room hunting! <br>\n<br>\n    </section>"

The building is about 10 years old, very clean and bug free.<br>\n<br>\nNeighborhood:<br>\nThe Atlantic Ave/Barclay's Center Express Subway and LIRR station (2/3/4/5/B/D/N/R trains) is 4 blocks away. The Fulton G and C stops are 2 blocks away. Stop and Shop, Best Buy, Target, and the Atlantic Terminal Mall are literally 1 block away. Neighborhood has a bookstore, 24-hour bodegas, laundromat, Crunch Gym, caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants etc. Ft Greene Park is 3 blocks away and Prospect Park (where I go running) is less than a mile to the south.<br>\n<br>\nRoommate:<br>\nI'm a 40-year old male, with a warm and friendly personality. I work in Accounting so my hours are a standard 9-6pm. I'm easy going and expect the same - someone fairly mature who is conscientious about cleaning up after themselves and respectful. I think it's nice to feel a sense of community so I'm always happy to chat but also respect the need for privacy. I rarely have multiple guests over, but I enjoy baking homemade pizzas and will host the occasional dinner party.<br>\nThe rent is $1215 plus utilities (Con Ed and Spectrum high speed internet) which average about $70/month. To setup an appointment to view the apartment, please send a reply with a short description of yourself. Proof of income, 1st month's rent and security deposit of $1215 are required prior to move in.<br>\n    </section>"

You found it! <br>\n<br>\nI will be in Europe during July and August. I am a music teacher/performer. My one bedroom apartment has full eat-in kitchen and full bathroom. <br>\n<br>\nBig screen TV (sorry no cable TV but access to Netflix and Pandora) <br>\nAC in both living room and bedroom <br>\nFull size keyboard <br>\nQueen size bed  <br>\nWiFi throughout the apartment <br>\n<br>\nThe pictures say the rest. The only thing that differs is that I now there is a desk that replaces one of the futons in the living room, and new floor tiles have been put in the kitchen.<br>\n<br>\nAbout transportation: <br>\n<br>\nIf you have a car, there is alternate days parking on the street.<br>\nIf you need public transportation, the D Train is two short blocks away on 205th street. Since it is the last stop on D line, you are guaranteed a seat on your way to Manhattan, which is 35 minutes away (to 59th st. Columbus Circle). <br>\n<br>\nThis is an ideal place for Montefiore Hospital medical staff as the hospital is within walking distance, and it is also a 10 min. walk away from the Botanical Garden. <br>\n<br>\nAbout the surrounding: <br>\n<br>\nPublic library: 2 blocks away <br>\n<br>\nShopping: Within a couple of blocks you can find CVS, FoodTown supermarket, groceries, dry cleaning, fast food (Pizza, Chinese, McDonald's, Subway) and banks (Bank of America and Chase). <br>\n<br>\nRecreation: There are three public parks available. Two of them within 5 minutes walk, one of which is newly built with running track and soccer/football field. The third one is Van Cortland Park which is the equivalent of Central Park in the Bronx. Equipped with a pool, running track, tennis courts, golf course and beautiful scenery. It is about 25 minutes walk from the apartment. There is a newly built Crunch gym literally around the corner. You can join without a contract for $9,95 a month.<br>\n<br>\nThe total monthly rent is $1,490 therefore $2,980 for the entire stay (utilities included). Priority will be given to people who are looking to sublet the place for the whole two months period, but other offers are welcome as well.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are interested, please reply to this ad via email.<br>\n    </section>"

I've been in the apartment for almost three years now and my roommate is moving out to go to California with her boyfriend. Rent is $1200 for the master bedroom. June 1st move in date. Below are some details:<br>\n<br>\nThe Apartment - is a huge beautiful place! Lots of light. Stainless steel appliances. Living room, dining room, huge kitchen. New bathroom. The apartment is also fully furnished. <br>\n<br>\nThe Room - The master bedroom is available for rent for $1200 for a June 1st move in date. The room is pretty big, also gets a lot of light, has two windows and a nice sized closet. Please note, this room is not furnished. <br>\n<br>\nThe Neighborhood - We are right off of 30th Avenue in Astoria. Tons of great restaurants and bars. The grocery store is right across the street, along with a laundry mat and a pizza place. We are 2 blocks from the R/M and about a 12 minute walk to the N/Q. Very quite street with families. It's a nice neighborhood to live in. <br>\n<br>\nRoommates - Just to give a little information about me, my name is Laurie and, like I said above, I've been in the apartment for about 3 years now, and I've been in Astoria for about 9 years. I work in the city in finance, typical 9-6 schedule. I am outgoing and friendly, I'm really clean, and I really love this apartment! I think you will too! <br>\n<br>\nOne last and final point, I am looking for someone who can commit to a year lease. The landlord is really great and they take such good care of the property. They will be looking for someone with good credit, full time job, and who will commit to a year. <br>\nLooking forward to hearing from you!<br>\n    </section>"

This is a sunny bedroom in a 3BR apt located on Broadway between 125 and LaSalle for the period 6/1-7/31 with possible option to renew the lease after 7/31.

Currently there's 1 male and 1 female living here!....You'll have your own private room with key locked door. Share bathroom and common areas!.....<br>\n<br>\nPLEASE READ:<br>\n<br>\nSorry no couples nor men this time unfortunately!. We're looking for another FEMALE to balance the chemistry In the household!<br>\n<br>\nYOU:<br>\n\"Mature, Opened minded, employed &amp; responsible\". . .. . .. . .. . ..<br>\n<br>\nPlease, no Xenophobes! I'd prefer someone who's able to live with and be open to cultures besides their own. My place is clean so I'd like a person who'll also keep it that way. Non smokers only/anything!,. I don't bring the party home so please do the same! Company every now and then and overnight guest isn't a problem especially on weekends but don't turn my place into your hotel. Light cooking is fine and gas and electricity is included as an \"INCENTIVE\" to renting out the room but not to be abused because the utility bills are very high. I have to pay to HEAT the apartment, the WATER and of course COOK.<br>\n<br>\nMe:<br>\nSelf employed entrepreneur in his late 40's.. I'm transitioning as a Photographer from an 20 year independent bookseller so its been pretty hectic juggling these positions. I'm heterosexual and involved In a relationship. My girlfriend has her own place, so you'll rarely if ever see or meet her. I respect other people's privacy and I'm looking for the same in a roomie. I don't really bother anybody and I kinda stay to myself but I'm also very social and possess a world of knowledge and am always willing to share. I like to consider myself as being very vocal on many issues and I often exchange thoughts and ideas on most topics! (excluding politics and religion) but ultimately, i like to give people their space (law of proxemics) and feel at home. I'm the lease holder and have been for 5 years now!. So you'll be granted the same rights as me but be a temporary guest so to speak and if we both agree, extend your stay perhaps 6-12 months more if we so decide!. My motto is: live and let live, so respect is paramount!<br>\n<br>\nHer:<br>\nShe's a 26yr old pioneering millennial, self employed in the fashion industry, actress &amp; yoga instructor. She's a tidy person but not OCD, keeps the common areas clean and cleans up after using them and is always willing to help keep them that way. She's very quiet and mainly stays to herself but is also very social once she gets to know you. She's also sweet and kind and has a sunny personality; which not only makes for a good friend but most importantly, a joy to live with and be around. She loves to read books, jogs several times per week, watch Indy films and is a big fan of Netflix and prides herself on personal care and healthy eating. She's organized, not selfish and respects other people's privacy and space and doesn't bring the party home and would like to room with someone who possesses some of her qualities if not most of them!<br>\n<br>\nWhat's Included?:......<br>\nThere will be free Internet service and utilities Included with your rent of $950 per month. 1st, last and one month's security. Again, this is a month to month temporary/transient rental, 2-3 months to start, possibly more!...Total $2850 to move in.<br>\n<br>\nThe Neighborhood:.....<br>\nGritty but safe with all races and cultures living harmoniously. This predominately working class community is in total transition as is all of Bushwick but hasn't lost its flair. It houses a near by 24hr Laundromat on Cooper St, Covert Coffee Shop, A Liquor store on Rockaway, Grocery stores, Spanish Restaurants, (Super Pioneer &amp; Bravo Super Markets). Jamaican and Indian restaurants, A Pizza shop, Plenty of 99 cent stores, Duncan Donuts, Subway, The Evergreen bar &amp; the popular Salud Bar &amp; Grill on Bushwick avenue and Moffat Street to name a few.<br>\n<br>\nFor further note:.....<br>\nYou will be residing within a short walking distance (3 min, Yay!) of the \"J &amp; Z\", M, L, A, &amp; C trains, each about 25min or less commute to Manhattan. If this sounds like a place that you'd like to rest your head and make your temporary home. Then come meet me and see the room because i can guarantee that you'll feel safe and at home throughout your entire stay!!,<br>\n<br>\nPLEASE DON'T FORGET TO:<br>\nLet me know a little about yourself: AGE, YOUR MOVE DATE, Please know about the most popular/hip place In Brooklyn, BUSHWICK!, highly recommended but not mandatory and I'll get back to ASAP!<br>\n<br>\nDue at signing:<br>\n$950.00 per month, 1st, last and one month's security to move In...Total $2850.00<br>\n<br>\nI Hope To Hear From You But If Not!.

Honestly, we love our apartment and it's in a really great location. I'm looking for one person to take her place! <br>\n<br>\nABOUT YOUR NEW APARTMENT: <br>\n<br>\n-\tAt the corner of 125 and Broadway in Morningside/West Harlem. <br>\n-\tA (literal) minute away from the very reliable 1 train and about ten minutes from the ABCD. <br>\n-\tIf buses are your thing we have those, too. Outside of our front door is the M4 and M104 for easy access to the east side. The M60 is five minutes away,  making getting to Queens (and LGA) super convenient. <br>\n-\tRiverside Park and the beautiful Hudson River pier are minutes away. <br>\n-\tFairway Market is a 6-minute walk and C-Town and Duane Reade are even closer. <br>\n-\tWe sit above many restaurants and bodegas. Starbucks moved a couple of doors down a couple of months ago. A new cocktail bar opened up recently (their pineapple cider is to die for), Jin Ramen is down the block, there is a killer juice/ health food store right downstairs, and Dino BBQ is also very close. <br>\n-\tThere are also tons of great food/ bar/ grocer options on Amsterdam ave, only a five minute walk away.<br>\n-       There are two laundry services as well as a laundromat within two blocks of the apartment. <br>\n-\tColumbia is a ten minute walk away!<br>\n-\tThe room has a window, a pretty spacious closet, and could fit a twin or full bed. <br>\n-\tThe rent is $1,100/month. Utilities generally run around $100/month per person. It's a little higher during the summer. <br>\n<br>\nI AM:<br>\n<br>\n-\tA 25-year-old female, usually gone between 12:00 PM &amp; 8:00 PM, M-F. <br>\n-\tOften ghostlike (ask my current roommate), so often it'll feel as if you have the apartment to yourself. <br>\n-\tPretty laid back and I like to bake cookies. <br>\n-\tOpen to having friends over! <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTO MOVE IN: <br>\n<br>\n-\tYou'll need a sense of humor plus $2,200 (first month &amp; security). <br>\n-\tTo sign onto the lease (which, is necessary) you have to prove your income (they like ~$60,000/year) or have a guarantor to back you. <br>\n-\tThe move in is for June 1st, but for the right person, earlier is definitely possible. <br>\n-\tWe are looking to show the apartment on this Sunday afternoon. Please shoot me a message to set this up. We look forward to hearing from you! :)<br>\n    </section>"

Like to keep the home cozy, clean, and comfortable and would like to find others that are into a \"family vibe\", like if someone else's dishes are in the sink you don't mind washing or if the garbage needs to go out you'll take the initiative to do it, and if you have extra kale and cant finish it you'll share =) hahha<br>\n<br>\nLikes- tequila, open &amp; honest communication, fresh air, astrology (we're a virgo &amp; capricorn), Broad City, SVU marathons, that moment when you step onto the subway platform and the train arrives seconds later, cashmere, adventures, &amp; good vibes. <br>\n<br>\nDislikes- door slamming, passive aggressiveness, filth, heavy walkers, indoor cigarette smoking, most reality TV, laziness, &amp; when cabinet doors are left open and main lights aren't turned off. Would like to have roommates that are capable of paying rent/utilities in a timely manner and to communicate any issues so that there's no passive aggressiveness or petty actions. <br>\n<br>\nThe apt is a 4bd/2bath in bedstuy BK off Myrtle-Willoughby G train maybe a 10-15 min walk from Myrtle JM trains.

We're looking for two new tenants to sign a one-year lease and move into our fantastic, sunny 5-bedroom, 2.5 bathroom Upper West Side apartment on June 1st. True private bedrooms...no fake walls or anything. Large living room, huge kitchen, laundry in the building, live-in super. The common areas are completely furnished.<br>\n<br>\nThe two tenants moving out are one girl and one guy, moving out of the area or in with a significant other. The original leaseholders signed the lease more than 10 years ago and it's been passed down throughout the years. It's truly a hidden gem in Manhattan. I love this place and you will, too.<br>\n<br>\nThe bedrooms each have a tall closet, large window and can hold a queen size bed and a dresser comfortably. <br>\n<br>\nThe apartment is located on the corner of West 96th and Broadway, a 30-second walk to the 1-2-3 express trains: a 5-minute ride to Times Square, 8-minute ride to 14th Street, and 15-minutes to Wall Street. You'll be at 30 Rock in about 10 minutes! We've got all the major banks within a one block radius, Westside Market one block away, and Whole Foods 3 blocks away.

I'm a 29-year-old female seeking 2 clean and responsible roommates (preferably female) to fill 2 rooms in my future spacious and funky apt in Williamsburg for the summer. This apt is 2 blocks from the L, close to tons of bars and restaurants and easily accessible to/from Manhattan. This is the top floor of a pre-war house with a finished basement.<br>\n<br>\nI am filling 2 bedrooms for a summer sublet - ideally June 1 - Aug 31, but I'm flexible on dates. Month-to-month is also an option. Both rooms will require one month's rent for security deposit. Unfortunately, there will be no opportunity to view the apt prior to June 1, but I can answer any questions and provide pics. <br>\n<br>\nI will be furnishing the common areas; the bedrooms will be unfurnished.<br>\n<br>\nBedroom A - $1300/mo - can fit a full-sized bed, dresser and clothing rack. There is no closet but a built-in storage space. There is a large window. This room might have an opportunity for a longer-term lease. <br>\n<br>\nBedroom B - $1350/mo - can fit a queen-sized bed and dresser. There is a large closet and 2 large windows. The term for this room will be June 1 - Aug 31. <br>\n<br>\nMore info upon request. No couples please.<br>\n    </section>"

Me and my roommate are staying and need to find 2 others to fill rooms for $775 $850. Utilities range from $50-$75/month but depend on season and usage.<br>\n<br>\nWe're 420 friendly/social drinkers, prefer the party to be kept outside of the home (apt is too 'cozy' for more than like 5 ppl) but totally cool having friends over/sleepovers just not like alloooooot. Like to keep the home cozy, clean, and comfortable and would like to find others that are into a \"family vibe\", like if someone else's dishes are in the sink you don't mind washing or if the garbage needs to go out you'll take the initiative to do it, and if you have extra kale and cant finish it you'll share =) hahha<br>\n<br>\nLikes- tequila, open &amp; honest communication, fresh air, astrology (we're a virgo &amp; capricorn), Broad City, SVU marathons, that moment when you step onto the subway platform and the train arrives seconds later, cashmere, adventures, &amp; good vibes. <br>\n<br>\nDislikes- door slamming, passive aggressiveness, filth, heavy walkers, indoor cigarette smoking, most reality TV, laziness, &amp; when cabinet doors are left open and main lights aren't turned off. Would like to have roommates that are capable of paying rent/utilities in a timely manner and to communicate any issues so that there's no passive aggressiveness or petty actions. <br>\n<br>\nThe apt is a 4bd/2bath in bedstuy BK off Myrtle-Willoughby G train maybe a 10-15 min walk from Myrtle JM trains. Located next to a community garden, block away from laundromat and about 2 blocks from grocery store. Coffee shops, restaurants, bars and cute shops are all within walking distance and home depot is super close too if you're into that (i am lol) <br>\n<br>\nNeed to commit to a year lease starting June 2017 and able to pass credit check, provide proof of income and pay first/last/security deposit to move in.    </section>"

I have been in the apartment with her for about a year and a half and can attest that she is quiet, respectful, amiable, and outgoing.  She keeps the living room and kitchen clean and always takes care of any mess that she makes.  She is respectful of bringing guests over by checking in with me first, and we would request that you do the same.  <br>\n<br>\nNo couples.  Smokers are fine as long as you do not smoke in the apartment.  We are looking for a long-term roommate who will be staying for at least six months.<br>\n<br>\nThe bedroom is very roomy, even by non-New York standards. \u00a0Prospect Park is a short walk away.  The kitchen and living room are already furnished with everything you need, though perfectly open to working things out if you also have your own set of common space furniture.  I will be taking most of my furniture in my room with me, but if you visit and anything strikes your fancy, we can talk.<br>\n<br>\nThe apartment is a block away from laundry and a grocery store, as well as an avenue away from restaurants, bars, a Duane Reade, and a variety of other miscellaneous stores.  (We are also getting laundry in the building very soon.)  It is a 5 minute walk to the B and Q, and a 10 minute walk to the 2 and 5.  <br>\n<br>\nI am looking for someone to move in at latest August 1, though I am willing to be flexible around your schedule should you wish to move in earlier, though probably no earlier than July 1.<br>\n<br>\nRent is $1025/month, which works out to between $1080-$1100ish with all utilities and internet.<br>\n    </section>"

Any gender roommate is welcome.<br>\n<br>\nOne block from Montrose L stop and near restaurants and shops.

We've got a room available on the lower level of the apartment. It's huge, has large windows that open (screens open too) and let a ton of natural light in. As seen in the pictures, the room fits a full-size (or queen) bed, a large desk, and more. There's no closet, but the white clothing unit will stay in the room for you! <br>\n<br>\nOther amenities: bathroom with jacuzzi tub, rooftop access to a gorgeous roof with Manhattan skyline view, and a very sweet fluffy cat. <br>\n<br>\nRent is $1100/month and deposit is $1100 (due on move-in).

We have 1 bedroom available in a spacious 5 bed/3 bath townhouse-style duplex apartment in a luxury building between 96th street and West End Ave. Current roommate is moving out as she wants to move downtown after a few years in the Upper West.<br>\n<br>\nThe bedroom is 9' x 15', has a large closest, and can comfortably fit a queen-sized bed and 2 dressers. The current roommate can leave the blackout shades and mounted flat screen TV free of cost if you'd like. The available bedroom is on the lower level of the duplex and shares a bathroom with one other person who is very neat (and awesome!). <br>\n<br>\nThe building has great amenities including a full-time doorman, gym, laundry, and rooftop-deck. It also has easy access to 1/2/3 trains at 96th St, is next to Riverside Park and is close to Central Park. The apartment itself is split-level, 2 bedrooms/1 bathroom downstairs and 3 bedrooms/2 bathrooms upstairs with a large kitchen (including dishwasher and oven) and a HUGE, furnished living room with a flat screen TV/cable/Netflix account.<br>\n<br>\nUs: One gal, two guys in our mid/late twenties, with one additional room opening up soon <br>\n<br>\nWe like to keep a relaxed atmosphere in the apartment. We are all respectful, friendly and social but have our own lives too, so the apartment never feels crowded. We don't bring the party home and all contribute to the upkeep of the apartment by keeping the common areas clean.  Utilities run around $50-$60 per month for internet, cable TV and electricity, and we also hire a cleaner every month.  Management pays for gas and heat.<br>\n<br>\nRoom is available starting June 1st or 15th (somewhat flexible/ negotiable). For building approval, though, paperwork needs to be submitted ASAP with first month's rent + one month security deposit. Males or females are welcome to apply but no pets please!<br>\n <br>\nIf you're interested, send us an email telling us a little about yourself (social media links appreciated!) and hopefully we can set up a time to show the room. Thanks!<br>\n    </section>"

There is a nice open living room with a large couch and love seat (often occupied by our two friendly cats), and an eating area with table and some chairs. The kitchen has tons of counter space courtesy of a bar that divides it from the living room space, and is well-stocked with gear (food processor, blender, cookware etc.). There are beautiful parquet floors and lots of nice little pre-war touches like lovely moulding, tile work, and a stained-glass window in the bathroom.<br>\n<br>\nWe're one block away from the Q train, which can get you over the bridge to Manhattan in twenty minutes. We're also a two-minute walk from glorious Prospect Park's southeast corner- close to the 60-acre lake and the swans, ducks, egrets that live there as well as the more open spaces than one finds on the north side. Pretty much every amenity is within a block or two. There is a farmer's market on Sundays, a large supermarket a block away, a Duane Reade, laundromat, hardware store, discount housewares, jerk chicken, great cheap produce stands, coffee shops and bars.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough we're near a major intersection, we're tucked away at the end of a funny little one-block residential dead-end street, so it's usually pretty quiet. The smallness of the street makes it conducive to neighbors getting to know one another. Several buildings have flower gardens going in the warmer months that have also been bringing the neighbors out more and more.<br>\n<br>\nRoom is nice, approximately 15' x 8', with two windows. It is unusually shaped (a bit like the hull of a ship--wide at one end and narrower at the other), but can easily fit a full or queen bed, desk and/or dresser, and bookshelf. One entire wall of the room is closet space (!!!). It will be available for a June 1 move-in.<br>\n<br>\nAbout us:<br>\n<br>\nSays housemate 1: \"I'm a queer, white female in my early 30s. These days, I'm most excited about the musical, political, mindful-living communities/activities I'm a part of. I like to keep my life filled with opportunities to practice yoga, ride my bike, see live performances, &amp; eat at fun restaurants/cook for friends. I work a busy day job in Manhattan that keeps me out of the apartment during the day. I like my home to be a place where I can relax, kick my feet up, read a good book, and snuggle with my 2 sweet, affectionate kitties, and where my friends/roommates feel comfy too. I like being close to the Park, while having easy commute to surrounding Brooklyn neighborhoods.\"<br>\n<br>\nSays housemate 2: \"I'm a straight-identified, queer-friendly lawyer/herbalist in my late 30s. I like to travel, read, dance, and connect with people and organizations re-imagining how we grow food, work, make home, and make meaning (permaculture, cooperatives, gift economies, restorative justice etc.). Investing in community is an important aspect of my life, and having a harmonious home is part of that. When I'm not working, you can find me walking in Prospect Park, hosting potlucks, singing (I'm in a choir), or planning a trip that will get me as far out of the city and off-the-grid as possible.\"<br>\n<br>\nWe are laid-back and kind, respectful of private space but happy to be around one another when we're home. We frequent food coops and farmers markets and are open to sharing food staples when practical, as well as meals when we happen to all be home. We also enjoy unwinding on the couch or stoop, having a beer, and sharing the ups and downs of life in the big city. We keep the apartment relatively clean and are non-smokers. We have a month-to-month lease, but are hoping for someone who would like to join us and settle in for a while. While we love our two cats, we don't have space for more pets.<br>\n<br>\nRent is $750/month, heat included. Utilities (electric, cooking gas, internet) generally run about $40/month per person. <br>\n<br>\nCare to join our home?<br>\n<br>\nTell us a little about yourself!<br>\n<br>\n(Pictures above show the stoop, common areas, room for rent, and the view of the lake at our corner of Prospect Park.)    </section>"
