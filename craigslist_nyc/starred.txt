Honestly, we love our apartment and it's in a really great location. I'm looking for one person to take her place! <br>\n<br>\nABOUT YOUR NEW APARTMENT: <br>\n<br>\n-\tAt the corner of 125 and Broadway in Morningside/West Harlem. <br>\n-\tA (literal) minute away from the very reliable 1 train and about ten minutes from the ABCD. <br>\n-\tIf buses are your thing we have those, too. Outside of our front door is the M4 and M104 for easy access to the east side. The M60 is five minutes away,  making getting to Queens (and LGA) super convenient. <br>\n-\tRiverside Park and the beautiful Hudson River pier are minutes away. <br>\n-\tFairway Market is a 6-minute walk and C-Town and Duane Reade are even closer. <br>\n-\tWe sit above many restaurants and bodegas. Starbucks moved a couple of doors down a couple of months ago. A new cocktail bar opened up recently (their pineapple cider is to die for), Jin Ramen is down the block, there is a killer juice/ health food store right downstairs, and Dino BBQ is also very close. <br>\n-\tThere are also tons of great food/ bar/ grocer options on Amsterdam ave, only a five minute walk away.<br>\n-       There are two laundry services as well as a laundromat within two blocks of the apartment. <br>\n-\tColumbia is a ten minute walk away!<br>\n-\tThe room has a window, a pretty spacious closet, and could fit a twin or full bed. <br>\n-\tThe rent is $1,100/month. Utilities generally run around $100/month per person. It's a little higher during the summer. <br>\n<br>\nI AM:<br>\n<br>\n-\tA 25-year-old female, usually gone between 12:00 PM &amp; 8:00 PM, M-F. <br>\n-\tOften ghostlike (ask my current roommate), so often it'll feel as if you have the apartment to yourself. <br>\n-\tPretty laid back and I like to bake cookies. <br>\n-\tOpen to having friends over! <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTO MOVE IN: <br>\n<br>\n-\tYou'll need a sense of humor plus $2,200 (first month &amp; security). <br>\n-\tTo sign onto the lease (which, is necessary) you have to prove your income (they like ~$60,000/year) or have a guarantor to back you. <br>\n-\tThe move in is for June 1st, but for the right person, earlier is definitely possible. <br>\n-\tWe are looking to show the apartment on this Sunday afternoon. Please shoot me a message to set this up. We look forward to hearing from you! :)<br>\n    </section>"
