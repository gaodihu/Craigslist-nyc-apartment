It is $1300 a month, all utilities included. Here is a description:<br>\nThis is a large, open studio basement apartment in Astoria, off the N/Q Astoria Blvd stop. This apartment has it's own entrance as well as its own air conditioning unit. There is plenty of storage space between the sliding closet and the empty chest of drawers. The furniture is included in the sublet, so all you would need is your own towel and some blankets. All utilities are included in the price of the rental including internet. If you are a musical person, or if you aren't, there is a full/fully weighted keyboard in the apartment for your enjoyment. There is recessed lighting throughout as well as tile flooring through the whole apartment. Couples are welcome, but unfortunately animals are not. No smoking in the apt. Everything in the kitchen is available for use. This is right near Astoria Park, less than 5 minutes from the Beer Garden as well as many other bars, cafes, shops, pharmacy's, and everything you can need. Laundry is not in the building but is right around the corner. This is 15 minutes from Times Square on the Subway and overall one of the safest neighborhoods you can be in!    </section>"

It is one bedroom in a three bedroom apartment, with shared kitchen and bathroom. The room is sizable (roughly 12'x7') with a huge closet, and a nice n' sunny window that looks out onto 2nd Ave.<br><br>\nMove-in requires May's rent and a $1300 security deposit, which will be returned in full at the end of July barring any damages to the property. Rent is to be paid either through Chase QuickPay or Venmo. Internet and utilities run on average $50/month per person. (They tend to increase a bit in summer when the roomies run their AC's.)<br><br>\nAs the other current housemates will be traveling/moving out in June and July, there will be a bit of a roomie-shuffle. <br><br>\nIf you have further questions or are interested, please call/text me at \n <a href=\"/fb/nyc/sub/6108031082\" class=\"showcontact\" title=\"click to show contact info\" rel=\"nofollow\">show contact info</a>\nand we can talk further/set up a viewing.<br><br>\nI will be showing the room next Tuesday evening, May 2nd. And next Wednesday, May 3rd, from early afternoon until 6 PM.<br><br>\n(To the grown potheads and blossoming alcoholics out there, this room is not for you I'm sad to say.)<br><br></section>"

Ideal candidate is another young woman who is friendly, relatively neat, and keeps regular hours, as we live above our landlords. <br><br>\nThese pictures were taken on a cloudy morning, but the apartment (and the available bedroom in particular) gets great light. Kitchen appliances are like new, and recently-refinished floor is gorgeous, and each room has a built-in air conditioner.<br><br>\nThe apartment is a 5-minute walk from the 36th Ave N/W, and close to great grocery stores, bars, and restaurants.<br></section>"

We're looking for a third roommate to join our converted 3-bedroom apartment. Our current roommate is moving in with her boyfriend at the end of May, so we're looking for someone to replace her on June 1. Our lease is up in October, but there's a possibility we'd renew and/or you could take over the lease.<br><br>\nAbout the room: it's a good-sized (for Manhattan!) bedroom that we set up in the far corner of our living room (2 walls are the living room corner (including a north-facing window that gets tons of light), 1 is a gigantic floor-to-ceiling shelving unit, and the 4th is a floor-to-ceiling curtain wall). We're super-respectful and low-key, so noise (given the curtain wall) has never become an issue with that room. The room comes furnished with a full bed, lamp, side table, and air conditioning unit in the window. <br><br>\nAbout the apartment: it's a pre-war (we think?) walk-up building in midtown east, with the E, M, and 6 right on our corner. The apartment is fully furnished and gets tons of natural light. There's also easy in-building laundry access downstairs. Utilities aren't included in the $1100 rent, but, on average, each of us usually pays around $30/month for electricity and $25/month for internet. We don't have cable, but we compensate for that successfully with Apple TV with Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, etc. :-)<br><br>\nAbout us: we're two mid/late-20s women, both working full-time (roughly 9:30-7, M-F) in digital media. We met as craigslist roommates and became good friends, and are looking for someone who's a great personality fit as well--having a comfortable and respectful home vibe is really important to us. We're laid-back, friendly and active (we don't spend much time in the apartment) and we're looking for the same in a new roommate. When we're home, it's usually to cook, watch a movie/show (we just finished Big Little Lies and Girls together), read, or just hang out and chat. We're clean and respectful of common areas, don't ever \"bring the party home,\" etc.<br><br>\nIf you're interested, please reply to this ad and tell us a bit about yourself (name, age, where you're from, occupation, routine, when you'd want to move in/how long you'd want to stay, any habits we should know about, questions you have for us, etc), and we'll get back to you!    </section>"

As the apartment already has 4 women, preference will also be given to a woman.<br><br>\nThe Room:<br>\nThe rooms only downfall is that it lacks a window to the outside. It has an air shaft window that can be opened but previous roommates haven't used it much. Currently the room has a twin sized bed but it can fit a full sized bed as well. We are still currently working out whether the room will be furnished so please keep that in mind when applying. You may need to bring your own bed. There will be an IKEA wardrobe in the room that can be used for a closet. Please see attached pictures! <br><br>\nATTENTION: We do have a cat. Her name is Peach and she is a snuggling kitty. We recently adopted her from the shelter. She is 7 years old. For this reason; we cannot accept anyone who currently has pets. And you must LOVE cats not just tolerate them because we expect you to be kind to our kitty. <br><br>\nMy Roommates:<br>\nI have 4 roommates, all with their own bedrooms. You will have your own private bedroom within the apartment. They are all in their 20s. <br><br>\nThe Apartment:<br>\nThe apartment is fully furnished and has two bathrooms. We split the bathrooms up between all of us but as one of them has a tub and the other has a stand up shower you are more than welcome to use which one you prefer. As you will be replacing me your \"home bathroom\" will be the one with the stand up shower. The apartment has a couch, table, TV, wifi, all the necessities and plenty of plates, bowls, forks, cooking utensils, etc. The apartment has been totally gut renovated with high end finishes, hardwood floors, tons of sunlight from windows, separate stainless steel kitchen with dishwasher.

The room is the loft on the 10th floor of a duplex, the penthouse of the building. It has its own private bathroom and entryway across the hallway from the elevator. This is for a temporary sublet: June 1-August 31. <br><br>\nThe apartment has:<br><br>\n-2 Balconies with western &amp; southern exposures<br>\n-2 Full Bathrooms<br>\n-Floor to ceiling windows throughout the unit<br>\n-Washer &amp; Dryer in the unit<br>\n-Dishwasher<br>\n-Stainless steel appliances<br>\n-Large closets and storage space<br>\n-Open, furnished, common rooftop with 360 degree views of NYC<br>\n-Central Heating and Cooling!<br>\n-Onsite parking available (at additional cost)<br>\n-Apartment is just blocks from Astoria Park &amp; the East River<br><br>\nIf you don't know Astoria, we can tell you all about it. Astoria is a thriving neighborhood, close to some of New York's finest restaurants and bars, including the Bohemian Beer Garden and supermarkets within blocks.<br><br>\nMatt (me), I am 34 years old, I am laid back, social, extrovert, who works in technology, dabbles in condo sales, and enjoys running, biking, hip hop dance and the occasional NPR, Radiolab, TED talk.<br><br>\nJamie, 30 years old, also laid back, creative, artistic, who works as a mobile product manager in ad tech. We both dig watching Netflix, sampling beers and running. <br><br>\nWe both have 9-6pm jobs. So our hours are kind of standard.  Neither of us party a lot, but we would consider the occasional fiesta.  We will have the occasional friend over. We are clean, but not anal retentive. Rent is $1133 and we pay gas and electric split 3 ways at worst it can come out to $150 additional per person (the disadvantage of having AC). <br><br>\nIf you are interested, please tell us something about your life, hobbies, where you work. We are looking forward to meeting you.  We are showing the room in the evenings of Monday, May 1 and Tuesday, May 2.    </section>"

There is laundry in the building next door that we have access to (takes quarters). Most residents are young professionals. The building is located on 50th Street between 3rd &amp; 2nd Avenues, with lots of great restaurants/happy hour spots nearby on 2nd.

During the week, we're not home too long in the evenings due to work/gym time, but we enjoy the occasional movie and wine night together and love to invite friends over/going out from time to time on the weekends. We try to keep the place tidy and are respectful of one another's space - we'd expect the same from our new roommate!<br><br>\nDetails on YOU:<br>\nFemale<br>\nLooking for a roommate around the same age<br>\nMust make at least $50,000<br>\nNo pets<br>\nNo drugs<br>\nNo smoking<br><br>\nDue on signing:<br>\nCompleted application form for management (will be a $100 application fee for their credit check)<br>\nProof of employment and income including: letter of employment, recent paystubs, federal tax return, bank statements<br>\nScan of photo ID<br>\nDeposit of $1,467 to be paid to current roommate<br><br>\nIf interested, please reply with some information about yourself, some form of social media, and when you're available to meet us (our availabilities are listed below).<br><br>\nSaturday, 4/29: 3pm-7pm<br>\nSunday, 4/30: 3pm-8pm<br>\nMonday, 5/1: 7pm-9pm<br>\nWednesday, 5/3: 7pm-9pm<br>\nFriday, 5/5: 6pm-8pm<br><br>\nPlease let us know any questions that you may have and happy apartment hunting!<br></section>"

A little early to advertise but just in case someone is already looking for September - I am not available through the summer after the end of May so I would like to show the room now for September move in. STILL AVAILABLE IF POSTING IS UP. For male to share apartment with one other male - only myself. Upper West Side. Probably most ideal and convenient area in all Manhattan to live in for everything. The West 72nd Street/Broadway subway is right next door (#1, 2 and 3 trains). Very clean, quiet, comfortable, well-furnished private room. Medium size - about 11'x11'. Share extra large eat-in-kitchen (I use it very little) and bathroom with one person (myself). Layout of apartment provides excellent privacy for each person - the closest thing to living alone. The two sleeping areas are very far apart and totally independent with many enclosing doors, separate ways to enter, etc. Own cable TV, A/C, wireless internet available. Laundry in building. Excellent well-maintained elevator building. Ideal for professional or student (very convenient for Columbia) seeking quiet environment who does not have a lot with them. The room is very fully furnished already and couldn't accommodate more furniture. $1295/month plus one month security and half utilities, but cable TV included. Non-smoking, no pets. Please reply with a little about yourself if you like - working, student, etc. No photos available now. I'd like to show it to those available to see it personally as soon as possible in May.<br></section>"

I'm a female (30) looking for another female to share a room. I've been sharing the room with a friend for past two years, but she's moving out to a new apt. You could move in June 1st, or July 1st. The lease is until September 30th. Then, I will move out to live with my husband. You can choose to stay and sign the lease with Jackie (27) - (there would be 3 of us in the apt, total) at the end of September, or leave - up to you. If you choose to stay, you can have the room to yourself for $1650/mo, or share it with a friend/boyfriend... for $825 each. We split the cost of electricity &amp; internet (usually around $35/each/mo). We clean the apartment thoroughly every 2 weeks (we take turns). We are looking for a friendly, CLEAN and QUIET female roommate - no drama please! :) This is a 2BD apt on 5th floor of a walk-up building. You would share the larger room with me. Looking forward to hearing from you! Kamila<br></section>"

There will also be the option to resign on the lease for another year. <br><br>\nYou- My roommates are looking for a mid to late twenty something year old professional female to move in on 6/1 and staying until the lease is up on 9/30. You are friendly, responsible, tidy and respectful to the japartment common spaces. <br><br>\nThe roommates- My current roommates are awesome! Very friendly and respectful while in the apartment. Both roommates are employed full time with Monday to Friday jobs in the Accounting and Media industries. Both live very active and busy lives outside the apartment. Apartment vibe is very chill/relaxed on weeknights and quiet by 10pm. They do not bring the party home and except the new roommate to do the same. <br><br>\nThe apartment- huge 1bd/1ba that has been permanently flexed into a three bedroom with FULL walls/doors. Roomates share the living room, kitchen (w/ dishwasher!) and bathroom. Huge closet in living space is split between the two flex rooms. Unit is on a high floor of a very nice full service high-rise in the financial district. (AC, elevators, 24 hr doorman, gym, laundry in building and one of the best roof tops in the area) Close to many subway lines at Fulton Street. Cleaning and apartment costs (wifi, electric, household goods) are split evenly by 3 (no more than $60) <br><br>\nThe room- Room has huge windows and full flex walls/doors for privacy. Very pretty views of the World Trade Center. Photos currently show a queen-size bed and dresser. Large closet in common room is shared with one other roommate. <br><br>\nHouse keeping/additional information:<br>\n- 1 month rent + security deposit required ($1250 security to secure + $1250 due prior to move in) Electric in the summer months is approx $60pp due to AC. <br>\n- Seublease will run from 6/1 to 9/30 with option to resign a new lease with current roomates starting in October. <br>\n- Must have employment and be able to show income for approx 40x your portion of the rent. Sorry but no consigners. There is an online application (with fee) and approval process that must be followed. Management is strict on their requirements. <br>\n- You will be added to the unit as an occupant and will be considered an official resident of the building. I will also remain on the lease until the end. <br>\n- As a side note, I will be selling a bunch of furniture cheap, if interested. (Queen bedframe/mattress, dresser, desk/chair etc) <br><br><br>\nWe are looking to fill the room asap but really value the fit of the new roommate so serious inquiries only! Open house style viewing to see the space this Wednesday at 7pm and meet the roommates- If you are interested please respond to the posting with a little bit of background about yourself (profession, hobbies, lifestyle etc) and feel free to ask additional questions. <br><br>\nThanks!<br>\nNikki    </section>"

Lower level has 2 bedrooms, full bath, and kitchen; upper level has 1 bedroom, living room, half bath, and access to private roof deck.<br>\n-2 blocks from the B, C trains and a 8-minute walk from the 1,2,3 trains<br>\n-Safe, secure, and all around amazing neighborhood<br>\n-Small kitchen fully stocked with dishes, cutlery, pots, pans, microwave, etc.<br>\n-Living room fully furnished<br><br>\nAbout the room:<br>\n-It's a converted room, but it's separated from the kitchen by tall armoires and a thick curtain so feels very private.<br>\n-Bedroom has exposed brick, a (non-functional) fireplace, and two windows that allow for great sunlight.<br>\n-Rent is $875/month and we would need one month's rent as a security deposit.<br>\n-We don't have cable (but we do have WiFi), so monthly utilities bills are low--about $50-70 per person<br><br>\nAbout us (possibly your future roommates):<br>\n-Both professional women in their early 30s.<br>\n-Roommates work traditional hours and lead active lives outside the apartment. They are always clean and respectful about sharing the space when home and are looking for the same.<br><br>\nWhen inquiring, please include a link to at least one form of social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc)    </section>"

I'm in my late 20s and currently work as an Operations Manager in a start-up company. I'm sociable and love getting to know people, but generally like things to quit down in the apartment by 11PM. I work long hours, so usually when I'm home, I'm resting or watching TV in my room.<br><br>\nAbout the apartment: <br><br>\nThe apartment is a true two bedroom, with lots of light and amenities. It is fully furnished with a sizable living room, separate kitchen, and renovated bathroom. The bedroom that you would be living in has 2 windows, walk-in closet, dresser and a window AC unit that can be reattached. The room costs $1200 + utilities, which is generally $50-60 per a month. This is ideal for anyone looking for a clean, safe place to stay.<br><br>\nAbout the neighborhood: <br><br>\nThe building is located a 3-4 minute walk from the 30th Ave. N/W subway and a 10 minute walk from the M/R station at Steinway. The neighborhood is safe and lively, with tons of bars and restaurants just steps away from the apartment.<br><br>\nAbout you:<br><br>\nIdeally, you would be a responsible (cannot stress this enough), quiet person who is sociable but doesn't throw parties. <br><br>\nMove in date is flexible (prefer to find someone by beginning of June) . Security deposit ($1200) + 1 month rent is required in order to move in.<br><br>\nFeel free to email me if you are interested or have any questions about the place.<br></section>"

There will also be the option to resign on the lease for another year. <br><br>\nYou- My roommates are looking for a mid to late twenty something year old professional female to move in on 6/1 and staying until the lease is up on 9/30. You are friendly, responsible, tidy and respectful to the apartment common spaces. <br><br>\nThe roommates- My current roommates are awesome! Very friendly and respectful while in the apartment. Both roommates are employed full time with Monday to Friday jobs in the Accounting and Media industries. Both live very active and busy lives outside the apartment. Apartment vibe is very chill/relaxed on weeknights and quiet by 10pm. They do not bring the party home and except the new roommate to do the same. <br><br>\nThe apartment- huge 1bd/1ba that has been permanently flexed into a three bedroom with FULL walls/doors. Roomates share the living room, kitchen (w/ dishwasher!) and bathroom. Huge closet in living space is split between the two flex rooms. Unit is on a high floor of a very nice full service high-rise in the financial district. (AC, elevators, 24 hr doorman, gym, laundry in building and one of the best roof tops in the area) Close to many subway lines at Fulton Street. Cleaning responsibilities are shared and apartment costs (wifi, electric, household goods) are split evenly by 3. <br><br>\nThe room- Room has huge windows and full flex walls/doors for privacy. Very pretty views of the World Trade Center. Photos currently show a queen-size bed and dresser. Large closet in common room is shared with one other roommate. <br><br>\nHouse keeping/additional information:<br>\n- 1 month rent + security deposit required ($1250 security to secure + $1250 due prior to move in) Electric in the summer months is approx $60pp due to AC. <br>\n- Seublease will run from 6/1 to 9/30 with option to resign a new lease with current roomates starting in October. <br>\n- Must have employment and be able to show income for approx 40x your portion of the rent. Sorry but no consigners. There is an online application (with fee) and approval process that must be followed. Management is strict on their requirements. <br>\n- You will be added to the unit as an occupant and will be considered an official resident of the building. I will also remain on the lease until the end. <br>\n- As a side note, I will be selling a bunch of furniture cheap, if interested. (Queen bedframe/mattress, dresser, desk/chair etc) <br><br><br>\nWe are looking to fill the room asap but really value the fit of the new roommate so serious inquiries only! Open house style viewing to see the space and meet the roomates this Wednesday at 730 pm. If you are interested please respond to the posting with a little bit of background about yourself (profession, hobbies, lifestyle etc) and feel free to ask additional questions.    </section>"

Great way to get off the summer lease cycle!<br><br>\nThe apartment is located on the Upper East Side, on 78th/York. The apartment is located one block from the M79 bus, and a ten minute walk to the 6 or the Q! Perfect location, especially for those in the medical profession, as it is a short walk to all the major UES hospitals. Also near all sorts of bars, restaurants, etc. and close to Central Park.<br><br>\nMy current roommate will be staying. She is 23 years old and works at Sloan Cancer Center. She isn't home often, and is very friendly and easy to live with.<br><br>\nThe common space in the apartment comes furnished (all I will be taking with me is the television). Kitchen includes a dishwasher. Bedroom will come unfurnished, and includes a closet. There is lots of natural light in the apartment, and it has been very well-maintained.<br><br>\nRent is $1250, and includes utilities. Laundry is in building, and it is part of the only gated community on the UES. This is a beautiful building, next to a park and the East River. There is a package room, and handymen on site. There is also security at night. Overall, this is a very safe neighborhood and I have never felt unsafe walking around, no matter the time of day/night.<br><br>\nThe building requires a credit check, so in addition to the $1250 rent they would require $80 for a credit check and $200 for the application fee.<br><br>\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, or know someone who would be interested! Happy to send more photos (these were taken prior to when we moved in) or to show the place.    </section>"

If you need longer, we can offer this room up until the middle of June. <br><br>\nThe room is somewhat furnished and ready to move in. The bedroom has floor to ceiling walls and a door with key so it is 100% private. We share the apartment with three other guys in their 20s, who have a professional working life, so everyone is highly responsible and noise levels are always low. I want to also stress this location is absolutely amazing, with ALL subway stops either on the same block as the building, or one or two streets away. This location is also on the same block as the Empire State Building, and our rooftop has great views and you will also have access to the gym/lounge on the top floor. Laundry, elevators, 24hr doormen in the building. There is tons of nightlife and food places around too. Literally everything you need is closely accessible!<br><br>\nAbout the roommates:<br><br>\nSo yeah, we're 3 dudes so it will get a little messy every now and then, but we get maid service once a month. Comes out to about $20ish. Bathroom situation is good too. I have to leave by 8:30am, Adam has to leave by 9:00-10ish, and Peter is usually not home. Either way, we don't really take too long in the bathroom. <br><br>\nAdam -- Half Asian, Software Engineer at a real estate analytics company, is chill. Most ladies would rate him as a 3/10 at best though, but is a great wingman. Nickname is Captain America. Has a tendency to walk around shirtless<br><br>\nPeter -- Asian, Consultant, travels pretty much every week so isn't home much, is chill.<br><br>\nDavid -- Asian, Product Manager at a health tech company, aspires to be a Youtube star, travels not as much as peter (but still often), is chill. <br><br>\nYou -- Is chill, doesn't really cook much, doesn't care it's 2 1/2 asian guys, is chill<br><br>\nIf you are interested in this room, please reach out to us with a little about yourself and when the earliest you can move in is. Also please provide linkedin and/or facebook as well. <br><br>\nThanks!    </section>"

Bars include Alaska, Pine Box (Vegan) Rock Shop, Duck Duck, etc. Local retail highlights include Friends, Beacons Closet and the new Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown. There are 3+ 24-hour health food stores in either direction, a juice bar, and lots of bodegas.<br><br>\nWe will need first month's rent + last month's rent + security upon move in, and you will get security back so long as you don't mess anything up during your stay.<br><br>\nWe all share utilities, general house supplies &amp; bi-weekly cleaning lady fees. All of this totals to between ~$25-$60 per person per month.<br><br>\nPlease include your facebook/twitter/instagram if you have one so we can determine compatibility!<br><br>\n**NO COUPLES - ROMANTIC OR PLATONIC ** NO ANIMALS **    </section>"

The apartment is two blocks away from the Carl Schulz Park and one block from East River Esplanade (great for walking/jogging). The rent is $1,140/month and utilities run approximately $70/month which includes wireless internet and electricity. You'd sign a lease though, so there'd be no surprises.<br><br>\nThis is a cozy two bedroom, one bath apartment. Your bedroom can easily fit a full-size bed and a dresser, and has two brand new windows - literally installed a few months ago. There is an elevator and laundry machine ($1.50 in quarters for each the washer/dryer) in the building. The apartment is on the 6th floor. The Super is SUPER responsive and lives in the building! :^) <br><br>\nTransportation: really close to the M31, M86, M79 Buses. It's about an 8 minute walk to the new 2nd Avenue Subway stop on 83/2 and a 15 minute walk to the 4/5/6 stop on 86/Lexington.<br><br>\nAbout me: I'm super busy - I work relatively long hours and will be studying for the GRE. I cook most nights, so I do use the kitchen - fully functional stove, refrigerator, etc. I'm really easy to get along with, I'm funny, I like basketball, Seinfeld, and Viceland. I am relatively clean and I'd expect you to clean up after yourself in the living room, kitchen, and bathroom.<br><br>\nAbout you: Male/Female, 21-31, stable job with proof of income. You need to contribute to buying shared things like toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc - if you see that something's running low, you should be cool with buying it for us (if I already haven't). Unfortunately no pets (I wish we could)! A big plus if you can bring some furniture for the common areas - a kitchen table and chairs, TV, etc will be needed after my roommate moves out.<br><br>\nA security deposit ($1850) is required upon move-in.<br><br>\nShoot me an email if the above sounds good to you! I don't want this to be a lengthy process, so if I like you, then you're good!<br></section>"

I work 9-6, M-F and usually am home by evening time to relax. On the weekends, I am either out and about in the city with friends or at chilling at home watching Netflix. I am clean, and would prefer to keep our living spaces to be as well. I don't expect us to be best friends, but would be down to hang out once in awhile, if that's something you're interested in. I am looking for a considerate, clean, and compatible roommate to live with. Keep in mind that you would be filling 1 of the 3 rooms, and the other roommate is also TBD.<br><br>\nIf everything above sounds like something you're interested in, please email a few sentences about yourself (age, what you do, typical schedule, hobbies, etc.) and any social media you feel comfortable sharing (i.e. IG, FB, LinkedIn).<br><br>\nThank you!    </section>"

I've been in the apartment for almost three years now and my roommate is moving out to go to California with her boyfriend. Rent is $1200 for the master bedroom. June 1st move in date. <br><br>\nBelow are some details:<br><br>\nThe Apartment - is a huge beautiful place! Lots of light. Stainless steel appliances. Living room, dining room, huge kitchen. New bathroom. The apartment is also fully furnished. <br><br>\nThe Room - The master bedroom is available for rent for $1200 for a June 1st move in date. The room is pretty big, also gets a lot of light, has two windows and a nice sized closet. Please note, this room is not furnished. <br><br>\nThe Neighborhood - We are right off of 30th Avenue in Astoria. Tons of great restaurants and bars. The grocery store is right across the street, along with a laundry mat and a pizza place. We are 2 blocks from the R/M and about a 12 minute walk to the N/Q. Very quite street with families. It's a nice neighborhood to live in. <br><br>\nRoommates - Just to give a little information about me, my name is Laurie and, like I said above, I've been in the apartment for about 3 years now, and I've been in Astoria for about 9 years. I work in the city in finance, typical 9-6 schedule. I am outgoing and friendly, I'm really clean, and I really love this apartment! I think you will too! <br><br>\nOne last and final point, I am looking for someone who can commit to a year lease. The landlord is really great and they take such good care of the property. They will be looking for someone with good credit, full time job, and who will commit to a year. <br>\nLooking forward to hearing from you!<br></section>"

We're looking for two new tenants to sign a one-year lease and move into our fantastic, sunny 5-bedroom, 2.5 bathroom Upper West Side apartment on June 1st. True queen-size private bedrooms...no fake walls or anything. Large living room, huge kitchen, laundry in the building, live-in super. The common areas are completely furnished.<br><br>\nThe two tenants moving out are one girl and one guy, moving out of the area or in with a significant other. The original leaseholders signed the lease more than 10 years ago and it's been passed down throughout the years. It's truly a hidden gem in Manhattan. I love this place and you will, too.<br><br>\nThe bedrooms each have a tall closet, large window and can hold a queen size bed and a dresser comfortably. <br><br>\nThe apartment is located on the corner of West 96th and Broadway, a 30-second walk to the 1-2-3 express trains: a 5-minute ride to Times Square, 8-minute ride to 14th Street, and 15-minutes to Wall Street. You'll be at 30 Rock in about 10 minutes! We've got all the major banks within a one block radius, Westside Market one block away, and Whole Foods 3 blocks away. We're right between Central Park and Riverside Park. <br><br>\nYour rent will be $1,350 plus utilities (cable/wifi/electric)<br><br>\nThe roommates: all three are young professionals in our mid/late-20's working in media. We like to have a good time but don't bring the party home. The females share one bathroom and the males share another, so there's never any awkward interactions.<br><br>\nWe love this place and we're looking forward to welcoming you into our home! Please reach out with a brief bio and a link to your Facebook/LinkedIn profile.    </section>"

There is no elevator (or doorman) but the apartment is located on the ground floor. You'll have your own quiet, private bedroom and will share a full bathroom, kitchen, living room, and private outdoor back patio. Plus, there are laundry machines located in the basement of the building. I am a 48 y.o. professional male looking to share this apartment with one mature, professional, non-smoking, cat-friendly person.<br><br>\nThe room is not large and does not get much, if any, sunlight but it has a large closet (located just outside the room). The apartment is a duplex and the bedrooms are on different floors. The kitchen is small but functional.<br><br>\nThe rent is $1,400 per month, which includes:<br><br>\nHeat<br>\nHot Water<br>\nElectricity<br>\nWiFi<br>\nCooking Gas<br><br>\nNot Included:<br><br>\nTelephone Land Line, if desired. You would be responsible for securing and paying for the installation of the phone line and any monthly service charges associated with it.<br><br>\nCable TV, if desired. There is a 40\" High Definition TV, Google Chromecast, and Blue-Ray DVD player in the living room but no cable TV service. Netflix, Hulu, and other similar services can be watched on the TV via Chromecast. If you want cable TV in the living room and/or your bedroom, you will be responsible for paying for it, including installation and all monthly fees. <br><br>\nThe room is available on June 1st - looking for a long-term roommate.

While the room and apartment are cozy (the room can best fit a twin/full size bed), it is in a prime downtown location on the border of SoHo and the South Village. It is within quick walking distance of multiple train lines (Spring Street 'C', Prince Street 'N/W/R', Varick Street '1,\" Broadway-Lafayette 'B/D/F/M'). It is also within walking distance of every amenity you can think of  prime SoHo shopping, Greenwich/West Village entertainment and restaurants, movie theaters, bars, etc. It's also a 5-minute walk to Washington Square Park, a 15-minute walk to the Hudson River, and a 10-minute walk to Union Square, which gets you to Williamsburg and Bushwick in no time. While the neighborhood itself always has a lot going on, the street my apartment is on is actually very quiet at night. This is a great place to live if you are looking to be out and about most of the time and want quick access to everything in NYC <br><br>\nThe room itself has a small closet and also an amazing fire escape with views of both the Empire State building and 1 World Trade that is lovely to sit on in the summer. You would be sharing the apartment with my roommate who is very quiet and clean; he graduated with me from the University of Chicago and works in tech. The apartment has a kitchen with lots of counter space, and a bathroom. The room does not come furnished.<br><br>\nI would require a security deposit of $1,300 which could be used towards the last month's rent, if all works out.    </section>"

A little early to advertise but just in case someone is already looking for September - I am not available through the summer after the end of May so I would like to show the room now for September move in. STILL AVAILABLE IF POSTING IS UP. For male to share apartment with one other male - only myself. Upper West Side. Probably most ideal and convenient area in all Manhattan to live in for everything. The West 72nd Street/Broadway subway is right next door (#1, 2 and 3 trains). Very clean, quiet, comfortable, well-furnished private room. Medium size - about 11'x11'. Share extra large eat-in-kitchen (I use it very little) and bathroom with one person (myself). Layout of apartment provides excellent privacy for each person - the closest thing to living alone. The two sleeping areas are very far apart and totally independent with many enclosing doors, separate ways to enter, etc. Own cable TV, A/C, wireless internet available. Laundry in building. Excellent well-maintained elevator building. Ideal for professional or student (very convenient for Columbia) seeking quiet environment who does not have a lot with them. The room is very fully furnished already and couldn't accommodate more furniture. $1295/month plus one month security and half utilities, but cable TV included. Non-smoking, no pets. Please reply with a little about yourself if you like - working, student, etc. No photos available now. I'd like to show it to those available to see it personally as soon as possible in May.    </section>"
