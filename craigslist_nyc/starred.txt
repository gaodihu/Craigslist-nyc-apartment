It is $1300 a month, all utilities included. Here is a description:<br>\nThis is a large, open studio basement apartment in Astoria, off the N/Q Astoria Blvd stop. This apartment has it's own entrance as well as its own air conditioning unit. There is plenty of storage space between the sliding closet and the empty chest of drawers. The furniture is included in the sublet, so all you would need is your own towel and some blankets. All utilities are included in the price of the rental including internet. If you are a musical person, or if you aren't, there is a full/fully weighted keyboard in the apartment for your enjoyment. There is recessed lighting throughout as well as tile flooring through the whole apartment. Couples are welcome, but unfortunately animals are not. No smoking in the apt. Everything in the kitchen is available for use. This is right near Astoria Park, less than 5 minutes from the Beer Garden as well as many other bars, cafes, shops, pharmacy's, and everything you can need. Laundry is not in the building but is right around the corner. This is 15 minutes from Times Square on the Subway and overall one of the safest neighborhoods you can be in!    </section>"
